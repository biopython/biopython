# Assumes being called from the Biopython repository's root folder,
# (i.e. a clone of https://github.com/biopython/biopython) as part
# of our continuous integration testing to save the compiled docs
# to https://github.com/biopython/docs
#
# i.e. AFTER you have run sphinx-build with:
#
# $ make -C Doc/api/ html
#
# First, we need to enable SSH. First, generate a key locally (You must use an empty passphrase):
#
#     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "biopython documentation deploy key" -f biopython_doc_key -N ""
#
# Output from the previous command should look something like this:

#     Generating public/private rsa key pair.
#     Your identification has been saved in biopython_doc_key
#     Your public key has been saved in biopython_doc_key.pub
#     The key fingerprint is:
#     SHA256:abunchofnumbersandletters biopython documentation deploy key
#     The key's randomart image is:

# Now we're going to add the public key to the docs project. To get the key, run the
# following command:
#
#     cat biopython_doc_key.pub
#
# and copy the output. Go to https://github.com/$USER/docs and
# substitute $USER for the organization your doing this for (biopython for
# the main repository, your GitHub username for your own fork).
# Click on Settings -> Deploy Keys -> Add deploy key
# In the title, pick a name that's descriptive and easy for you to remember.
# I'm going to use "biopython_doc_key". Paste the contents of the public
# key (the one you copied from the cat command a few moments ago) into the
# "Key" text box. Check "Allow write access" and click "Add key".
#
# Now, we have to add the private key to CircleCI. Go to
# https://app.circleci.com/settings/project/github/$USER/biopython
# once again replace $USER with either your github user name or
# biopython. Click "SSH Keys" in the menu on the left and click
# the button "Add SSH Key" at the bottom of the page. Leave the
# host name blank. In your terminal, run the following command:
#     cat biopython_doc_key
# and copy the contents. Back in the CircleCI UI, paste the contents
# you just copied into the "Private Key" text box. Click "Add SSH Key".
#
# We now have to set an environment variable called DOC_KEY
# in the Biopython project settings. To get this value in a format
# we can paste, run the following command and copy the output:
#
#     python -c "print(open('biopython_doc_key').read().strip().replace(' ', r'\ ').replace('\n', r'\\\n'))"
#
# In the CircleCI UI, click on "Project Settings" in the top right, 
# and go to "Environment Variables" on the left. Click "Add Environment
# Variable". In the "Name" input, put "DOC_KEY" and paste the value 
# you copied earlier into the "Value" input.
# 
# Finally, we need to add a User Key to the CircleCI biopython project.
# To do this, go to Biopython project in the CircleCI UI, click
# "project settings" in the top right, click "SSH Keys", and click
# "Add User Key." This allows CircleCI to act as a Git user and
# push the project to the docs repository.
