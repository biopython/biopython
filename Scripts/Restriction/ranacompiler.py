# This script is used to produce the dictionary which will contains the data
# about the restriction enzymes from the Emboss/Rebase data files, namely:
#   emboss_e.### (description of the sites),
#   emboss_r.### (origin, methylation, references)
#   emboss_s.### (suppliers)
# Where ### is a number of three digits : 1 for the year two for the month
#   The results are stored in
#   path/to/site-packages/Bio/Restriction/Restriction_Dictionary.py
#   the file contains two dictionary:
#   'rest_dict' which contains the data for the enzymes
#   and
#   'suppliers' which map the name of the suppliers to their abbreviation.
# very dirty implementation but it does the job, so...
# Not very quick either but you are not supposed to use it frequently.

"""Convert a series of Rebase files into a Restriction_Dictionary.py module.

The Rebase files are in the emboss format:
 - ``emboss_e.###`` - contains information about the restriction sites.
 - ``emboss_r.###`` - contains general information about the enzymes.
 - ``emboss_s.###`` - contains information about the suppliers.

Here ``###`` is the 3 digit number REBASE release number (e.g. 312). The first
digit is the last digit of the year (e.g. 3 for 2013) and the two last the
month (e.g. 12 for December).

These files are available by FTP from ftp://ftp.neb.com/pub/rebase/ which
should allow automated fetching via ``rebase_update.py``.
In addition there are links on this HTML page which allows manual download
and renaming of the files: http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.f37.html
This Python file is intended to be used via the scripts in
`Scripts/Restriction/*.py` only.
