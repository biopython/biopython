Parser Design
-------------

Many of the older Biopython parsers were built around an event-oriented
design that includes Scanner and Consumer objects.

Scanners take input from a data source and analyze it line by line,
sending off an event whenever it recognizes some information in the
data. For example, if the data includes information about an organism
name, the scanner may generate an ``organism_name`` event whenever it
encounters a line containing the name.

Consumers are objects that receive the events generated by Scanners.
Following the previous example, the consumer receives the
``organism_name`` event, and the processes it in whatever manner
necessary in the current application.

This is a very flexible framework, which is advantageous if you want to
be able to parse a file format into more than one representation. For
example, the ``Bio.GenBank`` module uses this to construct either
``SeqRecord`` objects or file-format-specific record objects.

More recently, many of the parsers added for ``Bio.SeqIO`` and
``Bio.AlignIO`` take a much simpler approach, but only generate a single
object representation (``SeqRecord`` and ``MultipleSeqAlignment``
objects respectively). In some cases the ``Bio.SeqIO`` parsers actually
wrap another Biopython parser - for example, the ``Bio.SwissProt``
parser produces SwissProt format specific record objects, which get
converted into ``SeqRecord`` objects.

Substitution Matrices
---------------------

SubsMat
~~~~~~~

This module provides a class and a few routines for generating
substitution matrices, similar to BLOSUM or PAM matrices, but based on
user-provided data. Additionally, you may select a matrix from
MatrixInfo.py, a collection of established substitution matrices. The
``SeqMat`` class derives from a dictionary:

.. code:: python

   class SeqMat(dict)

The dictionary is of the form
``{(i1,j1):n1, (i1,j2):n2,...,(ik,jk):nk}`` where i, j are alphabet
letters, and n is a value.

#. Attributes

   #. ``self.alphabet``: a class as defined in Bio.Alphabet

   #. ``self.ab_list``: a list of the alphabet’s letters, sorted. Needed
      mainly for internal purposes

#. Methods

   #. .. code:: python

         __init__(self,data=None,alphabet=None, mat_name='', build_later=0):

      #. ``data``: can be either a dictionary, or another SeqMat
         instance.

      #. ``alphabet``: a Bio.Alphabet instance. If not provided,
         construct an alphabet from data.

      #. ``mat_name``: matrix name, such as "BLOSUM62" or "PAM250"

      #. ``build_later``: default false. If true, user may supply only
         alphabet and empty dictionary, if intending to build the matrix
         later. this skips the sanity check of alphabet size vs. matrix
         size.

   #. .. code:: python

         entropy(self,obs_freq_mat)

      #. ``obs_freq_mat``: an observed frequency matrix. Returns the
         matrix’s entropy, based on the frequency in ``obs_freq_mat``.
         The matrix instance should be LO or SUBS.

   #. .. code:: python

         sum(self)

      Calculates the sum of values for each letter in the matrix’s
      alphabet, and returns it as a dictionary of the form
      ``{i1: s1, i2: s2,...,in:sn}``, where:

      -  i: an alphabet letter;

      -  s: sum of all values in a half-matrix for that letter;

      -  n: number of letters in alphabet.

   #. .. code:: python

         print_mat(self,f,format="%4d",bottomformat="%4s",alphabet=None)

      prints the matrix to file handle f. ``format`` is the format field
      for the matrix values; ``bottomformat`` is the format field for
      the bottom row, containing matrix letters. Example output for a
      3-letter alphabet matrix:

      .. code:: text

         A 23
         B 12 34
         C 7  22  27
           A   B   C

      The ``alphabet`` optional argument is a string of all characters
      in the alphabet. If supplied, the order of letters along the axes
      is taken from the string, rather than by alphabetical order.

#. Usage

   The following section is laid out in the order by which most people
   wish to generate a log-odds matrix. Of course, interim matrices can
   be generated and investigated. Most people just want a log-odds
   matrix, that’s all.

   #. Generating an Accepted Replacement Matrix

      Initially, you should generate an accepted replacement matrix
      (ARM) from your data. The values in ARM are the counted number of
      replacements according to your data. The data could be a set of
      pairs or multiple alignments. So for instance if Alanine was
      replaced by Cysteine 10 times, and Cysteine by Alanine 12 times,
      the corresponding ARM entries would be:

      .. code:: text

         ('A','C'): 10, ('C','A'): 12

      as order doesn’t matter, user can already provide only one entry:

      .. code:: text

         ('A','C'): 22

      A SeqMat instance may be initialized with either a full (first
      method of counting: 10, 12) or half (the latter method, 22)
      matrices. A full protein alphabet matrix would be of the size
      20x20 = 400. A half matrix of that alphabet would be 20x20/2 +
      20/2 = 210. That is because same-letter entries don’t change. (The
      matrix diagonal). Given an alphabet size of N:

      #. Full matrix size: N*N

      #. Half matrix size: N(N+1)/2

      The SeqMat constructor automatically generates a half-matrix, if a
      full matrix is passed. If a half matrix is passed, letters in the
      key should be provided in alphabetical order: (’A’,’C’) and not
      (’C’,A’).

      At this point, if all you wish to do is generate a log-odds
      matrix, please go to the section titled Example of Use. The
      following text describes the nitty-gritty of internal functions,
      to be used by people who wish to investigate their
      nucleotide/amino-acid frequency data more thoroughly.

   #. Generating the observed frequency matrix (OFM)

      Use:

      .. code:: python

         OFM = SubsMat._build_obs_freq_mat(ARM)

      The OFM is generated from the ARM, only instead of replacement
      counts, it contains replacement frequencies.

   #. Generating an expected frequency matrix (EFM)

      Use:

      .. code:: python

         EFM = SubsMat._build_exp_freq_mat(OFM,exp_freq_table)

      #. ``exp_freq_table``: should be a FreqTable instance. See
         section :ref:`sec:freq_table` for detailed information
         on FreqTable. Briefly, the expected frequency table has the
         frequencies of appearance for each member of the alphabet. It
         is implemented as a dictionary with the alphabet letters as
         keys, and each letter’s frequency as a value. Values sum to 1.

      The expected frequency table can (and generally should) be
      generated from the observed frequency matrix. So in most cases you
      will generate ``exp_freq_table`` using:

      .. code:: pycon

         >>> exp_freq_table = SubsMat._exp_freq_table_from_obs_freq(OFM)
         >>> EFM = SubsMat._build_exp_freq_mat(OFM, exp_freq_table)

      But you can supply your own ``exp_freq_table``, if you wish

   #. Generating a substitution frequency matrix (SFM)

      Use:

      .. code:: python

         SFM = SubsMat._build_subs_mat(OFM,EFM)

      Accepts an OFM, EFM. Provides the division product of the
      corresponding values.

   #. Generating a log-odds matrix (LOM)

      Use:

      .. code:: python

         LOM=SubsMat._build_log_odds_mat(SFM[,logbase=10,factor=10.0,round_digit=1])

      #. Accepts an SFM.

      #. ``logbase``: base of the logarithm used to generate the
         log-odds values.

      #. ``factor``: factor used to multiply the log-odds values. Each
         entry is generated by log(LOM[key])*factor And rounded to the
         ``round_digit`` place after the decimal point, if required.

#. Example of use

   As most people would want to generate a log-odds matrix, with minimum
   hassle, SubsMat provides one function which does it all:

   .. code:: python

      make_log_odds_matrix(acc_rep_mat,exp_freq_table=None,logbase=10,
                            factor=10.0,round_digit=0):

   #. ``acc_rep_mat``: user provided accepted replacements matrix

   #. ``exp_freq_table``: expected frequencies table. Used if provided,
      if not, generated from the ``acc_rep_mat``.

   #. ``logbase``: base of logarithm for the log-odds matrix. Default
      base 10.

   #. ``round_digit``: number after decimal digit to which result should
      be rounded. Default zero.

.. _sec:freq_table:

FreqTable
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   FreqTable.FreqTable(UserDict.UserDict)

#. Attributes:

   #. ``alphabet``: A Bio.Alphabet instance.

   #. ``data``: frequency dictionary

   #. ``count``: count dictionary (in case counts are provided).

#. Functions:

   #. ``read_count(f)``: read a count file from stream f. Then convert
      to frequencies.

   #. ``read_freq(f)``: read a frequency data file from stream f. Of
      course, we then don’t have the counts, but it is usually the
      letter frequencies which are interesting.

#. Example of use: The expected count of the residues in the database is
   sitting in a file, whitespace delimited, in the following format
   (example given for a 3-letter alphabet):

   .. code:: text

      A   35
      B   65
      C   100

   And will be read using the ``FreqTable.read_count(file_handle)``
   function.

   An equivalent frequency file:

   .. code:: text

      A  0.175
      B  0.325
      C  0.5

   Conversely, the residue frequencies or counts can be passed as a
   dictionary. Example of a count dictionary (3-letter alphabet):

   .. code:: python

      {'A': 35, 'B': 65, 'C': 100}

   Which means that an expected data count would give a 0.5 frequency
   for ’C’, a 0.325 probability of ’B’ and a 0.175 probability of ’A’
   out of 200 total, sum of A, B and C)

   A frequency dictionary for the same data would be:

   .. code:: python

      {'A': 0.175, 'B': 0.325, 'C': 0.5}

   Summing up to 1.

   When passing a dictionary as an argument, you should indicate whether
   it is a count or a frequency dictionary. Therefore the FreqTable
   class constructor requires two arguments: the dictionary itself, and
   FreqTable.COUNT or FreqTable.FREQ indicating counts or frequencies,
   respectively.

   Read expected counts. readCount will already generate the frequencies
   Any one of the following may be done to geerate the frequency table
   (ftab):

   .. code:: pycon

      >>> from SubsMat import *
      >>> ftab = FreqTable.FreqTable(my_frequency_dictionary, FreqTable.FREQ)
      >>> ftab = FreqTable.FreqTable(my_count_dictionary, FreqTable.COUNT)
      >>> ftab = FreqTable.read_count(open("myCountFile"))
      >>> ftab = FreqTable.read_frequency(open("myFrequencyFile"))
