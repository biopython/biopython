\title{Biopython Installation}
\author{Brad Chapman, with other contributors}

\maketitle

This document used to describe how to install Biopython back in the
Python 2 era, but was never fully revised to cover Python 2.7 or the
introduction of pre-compiled wheel files.

Instead, please see the main README file in a source code release, or
at our repository on GitHub:
