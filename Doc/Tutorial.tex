% This is the main LaTeX file which is used to produce the Biopython
% Tutorial documentation.
%
% If you just want to read the documentation, you can pick up ready-to-go
% copies in both pdf and html format from:
%
% http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html
% http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf
%
% If you want to typeset the documentation, you'll need a standard TeX/LaTeX
% distribution (I use teTeX, which works great for me on Unix platforms).
% Additionally, you need HeVeA (or at least hevea.sty), which can be
% found at:
%
% http://pauillac.inria.fr/~maranget/hevea/index.html
%
% You will also need the pictures included in the document, some of
% which are UMLish diagrams created by Dia
% (http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia.html).
% These diagrams are available from Biopython git in the original dia
% format, which you can easily save as .png format using Dia itself.
% They are also checked in as the png files, so if you make
% modifications to the original dia files, the png files should also be
% changed.
%
% Once you're all set, you should be able to generate pdf by running:
%
% pdflatex Tutorial.tex  (to generate the first draft)
% pdflatex Tutorial.tex  (to get the cross references right)
% pdflatex Tutorial.tex  (to get the table of contents right)
%
% To generate the html, you'll need HeVeA installed. You should be
% able to just run:
%
% hevea -fix Tutorial.tex
%
% However, on older versions of hevea you may first need to remove the
% Tutorial.aux file generated by LaTeX, then run hevea twice to get
% the references right.
%
% If you want to typeset this and have problems, please report them
% at biopython-dev@biopython.org, and we'll try to get things resolved. We
% always love to have people interested in the documentation!
