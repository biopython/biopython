.. Biopython API documentation master file, based on sphinx-quickstart
   This depends on having sphinx-apidoc run on both Bio and BioSQL to
   generate the per-module/package RST file referenced here.

Welcome to Biopython's API documentation!
=========================================

This content is automatically extracted from the "docstrings" within the
Biopython source code, which can be viewed within an interactive Python
session using the ``help()`` command.

Historically Biopython used `epydoc <http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>`_ for
making API documentation webpages, hosted here:

https://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/

This copy was generated using the more modern `Sphinx with autodoc
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ instead.
