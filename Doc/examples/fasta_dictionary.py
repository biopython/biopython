"""Example using Bio.SeqIO to load a FASTA file as a dictionary.

An example function (get_accession_num) is defined to demonstrate
a non-trivial naming scheme where the dictionary key is based on
the record identifier.

The first version uses Bio.SeqIO.parse() and loads the entire
FASTA file into memory as a Python dictionary of SeqRecord
objects. This is *not* suitable for large files.

The second version used Bio.SeqIO.index() which is suitable
for FASTA files with millions of records.

See also Bio.SeqIO.index_db() and the examples in the main tutorial.
