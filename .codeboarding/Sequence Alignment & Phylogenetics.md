## Component Details



The Sequence Alignment & Phylogenetics component in Biopython provides a comprehensive suite of tools for handling biological sequence alignments and constructing, manipulating, and analyzing phylogenetic trees. It encompasses core data structures for alignments and trees, functionalities for reading and writing various file formats, algorithms for pairwise and multiple sequence alignment, methods for phylogenetic tree construction and consensus, and integration with external tools like PAML. The main flow involves loading sequence data, performing alignments, analyzing alignment properties, constructing phylogenetic trees, and visualizing or exporting the results.



### Alignment Core

This component defines the fundamental data structures for sequence alignments, including `Alignment` for single alignments and `MultipleSeqAlignment` for collections of aligned sequences. It provides methods for manipulating, formatting, and accessing alignment data.
