        Only an index of the form [:] (i.e., a full slice) is supported.
        The file stream is returned to its zero position, and the file header
        is read and stored in an Alignments object. Next, we iterate over the
        alignments and store them in the Alignments object.  The iterator
        is then returned to its original position in the file, and the
        Alignments object is returned. The Alignments object contains the exact
        same information as the Alignment iterator self, but stores the
        alignments in a list instead of as an iterator, allowing indexing.

        Typical usage is

        >>> from Bio import Align
        >>> alignments = Align.parse("Blat/dna_rna.psl", "psl")
        >>> alignments.metadata
        {'psLayout version': '3'}

        As `alignments` is an iterator and not a list, we cannot retrieve an
        alignment by its index:

        >>> alignment = alignments[2]  # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          ...
        KeyError: 'only [:] (a full slice) can be used as the index'

        So we use the iterator to create a list-like Alignments object:

        >>> alignments = alignments[:]

        While `alignments` is a list-like object, it has the same `metadata`
        attribute representing the information stored in the file header:

        >>> alignments.metadata
        {'psLayout version': '3'}

        Now we can index individual alignments:

        >>> len(alignments)
        4
        >>> alignment = alignments[2]
        >>> alignment.target.id, alignment.query.id
