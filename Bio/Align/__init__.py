class MultipleSeqAlignment(_Alignment):
    """Represents a classical multiple sequence alignment (MSA).

    By this we mean a collection of sequences (usually shown as rows) which
    are all the same length (usually with gap characters for insertions or
    padding). The data can then be regarded as a matrix of letters, with well
    defined columns.

    You would typically create an MSA by loading an alignment file with the
    AlignIO module:

    >>> from Bio import AlignIO
    >>> align = AlignIO.read("Clustalw/opuntia.aln", "clustal")
    >>> print(align)
    SingleLetterAlphabet() alignment with 7 rows and 156 columns

    TATACATTAAAGGAGGGGGATGCGGATAAATGGAAAGGCGAAAG...AGA gi|6273291|gb|AF191665.1|AF191

    In some respects you can treat these objects as lists of SeqRecord objects,
    each representing a row of the alignment. Iterating over an alignment gives
    the SeqRecord object for each row:

    >>> len(align)
    7
    >>> for record in align:
    ...     print("%s %i" % (record.id, len(record)))
    gi|6273285|gb|AF191659.1|AF191 156
    gi|6273284|gb|AF191658.1|AF191 156
    gi|6273287|gb|AF191661.1|AF191 156
    gi|6273286|gb|AF191660.1|AF191 156
    gi|6273290|gb|AF191664.1|AF191 156
    gi|6273289|gb|AF191663.1|AF191 156
    gi|6273291|gb|AF191665.1|AF191 156

    You can also access individual rows as SeqRecord objects via their index:

    >>> print(align[0].id)
    gi|6273285|gb|AF191659.1|AF191
    >>> print(align[-1].id)
    gi|6273291|gb|AF191665.1|AF191

    And extract columns as strings:

    >>> print(align[:, 1])
    AAAAAAA

    Or, take just the first ten columns as a sub-alignment:

    >>> print(align[:, :10])
    SingleLetterAlphabet() alignment with 7 rows and 10 columns
    TATACATTAA gi|6273285|gb|AF191659.1|AF191
    TATACATTAA gi|6273284|gb|AF191658.1|AF191

    TATACATTAA gi|6273291|gb|AF191665.1|AF191

    Combining this alignment slicing with alignment addition allows you to
    remove a section of the alignment. For example, taking just the first
    and last ten columns:

    >>> print(align[:, :10] + align[:, -10:])
    SingleLetterAlphabet() alignment with 7 rows and 20 columns

    Note - This object is intended to replace the existing Alignment object
    defined in module Bio.Align.Generic but is not fully backwards compatible
    with it.

    Note - This object does NOT attempt to model the kind of alignments used
    in next generation sequencing with multiple sequencing reads which are
    much shorter than the alignment, and where there is usually a consensus or
    reference sequence with special status.

                     empty list.
         - alphabet - The alphabet for the whole alignment, typically a gapped
                      alphabet, which should be a super-set of the individual

        about adding them - by row or by column. Using the extend method adds by row.
        Using the addition operator adds by column. For example,

        ...                             annotations={"tool": "demo", "name": "end"})

        Now, let's look at these two alignments:

        >>> print(left)
        DNAAlphabet() alignment with 3 rows and 5 columns
        AAAAC Alpha
        AAA-C Beta
        AAAAG Gamma
        >>> print(right)
        DNAAlphabet() alignment with 3 rows and 2 columns
        GT Alpha
        GT Beta
        GT Gamma

        And add them:

        >>> combined = left + right
        >>> print(combined)
        DNAAlphabet() alignment with 3 rows and 7 columns
        AAAACGT Alpha
        AAA-CGT Beta
        AAAAGGT Gamma

        For this to work, both alignments must have the same number of records (here
        they both have 3 rows):

        >>> len(left)
        3
        >>> len(right)
        3
        >>> len(combined)
        3

        The individual rows are SeqRecord objects, and these can be added together. Refer
        to the SeqRecord documentation for details of how the annotation is handled. This
        example is a special case in that both original alignments shared the same names,
        meaning when the rows are added they also get the same name.

        Any common annotations are preserved, but differing annotation is lost. This is
        the same behaviour used in the SeqRecord annotations and is designed to prevent
        accidental propagation of inappropriate values:

        >>> b = SeqRecord(Seq("AAA-CGT", generic_dna), id="Beta")
        >>> c = SeqRecord(Seq("AAAAGGT", generic_dna), id="Gamma")
        >>> d = SeqRecord(Seq("AAAACGT", generic_dna), id="Delta")
        >>> e = SeqRecord(Seq("AAA-GGT", generic_dna), id="Epsilon")
        >>> align = MultipleSeqAlignment([a, b, c, d, e], generic_dna)

        You can access a row of the alignment as a SeqRecord using an integer
        index (think of the alignment as a list of SeqRecord objects here):

        >>> first_record = align[0]
        >>> print("%s %s" % (first_record.id, first_record.seq))
        Alpha AAAACGT
        >>> last_record = align[-1]
        >>> print("%s %s" % (last_record.id, last_record.seq))
        Epsilon AAA-GGT

        You can also access use python's slice notation to create a sub-alignment
        containing only some of the SeqRecord objects:

        >>> sub_alignment = align[2:5]
        >>> print(sub_alignment)
        DNAAlphabet() alignment with 3 rows and 7 columns
        AAAAGGT Gamma
        AAAACGT Delta
        AAA-GGT Epsilon

        This includes support for a step, i.e. align[start:end:step], which
        can be used to select every second sequence:

        >>> sub_alignment = align[::2]
        >>> print(sub_alignment)
        DNAAlphabet() alignment with 3 rows and 7 columns
        AAAACGT Alpha
        AAAAGGT Gamma
        AAA-GGT Epsilon

        Or to get a copy of the alignment with the rows in reverse order:

        >>> rev_alignment = align[::-1]
        >>> print(rev_alignment)
        DNAAlphabet() alignment with 5 rows and 7 columns
        AAA-GGT Epsilon
        AAAACGT Delta
        AAAAGGT Gamma
        AAA-CGT Beta
        AAAACGT Alpha

        You can also use two indices to specify both rows and columns. Using simple
        integers gives you the entry as a single character string. e.g.

        >>> align[3, 4]
        'C'

        This is equivalent to:

        >>> align[3][4]
        'C'

        or:

        >>> align[3].seq[4]
        'C'

        To get a single column (as a string) use this syntax:

        >>> align[:, 4]
        'CCGCG'

        Or, to get part of a column,

        >>> align[1:3, 4]
        'CG'

        However, in general you get a sub-alignment,

        >>> print(align[1:5, 3:6])
        DNAAlphabet() alignment with 4 rows and 3 columns
        -CG Beta
        AGG Gamma
        ACG Delta
        -GG Epsilon

        This should all seem familiar to anyone who has used the NumPy
        array or matrix objects.

    def sort(self, key=None, reverse=False):
        """Sort the rows (SeqRecord objects) of the alignment in place.

        This sorts the rows alphabetically using the SeqRecord object id by
        default. The sorting can be controlled by supplying a key function
        which must map each SeqRecord to a sort value.

        This is useful if you want to add two alignments which use the same
        record identifiers, but in a different order. For example,

        >>> from Bio.Alphabet import generic_dna
        >>> from Bio.Seq import Seq
        >>> from Bio.SeqRecord import SeqRecord
        >>> from Bio.Align import MultipleSeqAlignment
        >>> align1 = MultipleSeqAlignment([
        ...              SeqRecord(Seq("ACGT", generic_dna), id="Human"),
        ...              SeqRecord(Seq("ACGG", generic_dna), id="Mouse"),
        ...              SeqRecord(Seq("ACGC", generic_dna), id="Chicken"),
        ...          ])
        >>> align2 = MultipleSeqAlignment([
        ...              SeqRecord(Seq("CGGT", generic_dna), id="Mouse"),
        ...              SeqRecord(Seq("CGTT", generic_dna), id="Human"),
        ...              SeqRecord(Seq("CGCT", generic_dna), id="Chicken"),
        ...          ])

        If you simple try and add these without sorting, you get this:

        >>> print(align1 + align2)
        DNAAlphabet() alignment with 3 rows and 8 columns
        ACGTCGGT <unknown id>
        ACGGCGTT <unknown id>
        ACGCCGCT Chicken

        Consult the SeqRecord documentation which explains why you get a
        default value when annotation like the identifier doesn't match up.
        However, if we sort the alignments first, then add them we get the
        desired result:

        >>> align1.sort()
        >>> align2.sort()
        >>> print(align1 + align2)
        DNAAlphabet() alignment with 3 rows and 8 columns
        ACGCCGCT Chicken
        ACGTCGTT Human
        ACGGCGGT Mouse

        As an example using a different sort order, you could sort on the
        GC content of each sequence.

        >>> from Bio.SeqUtils import GC
        >>> print(align1)
        DNAAlphabet() alignment with 3 rows and 4 columns
        ACGC Chicken
        ACGT Human
        ACGG Mouse
        >>> align1.sort(key = lambda record: GC(record.seq))
        >>> print(align1)
        DNAAlphabet() alignment with 3 rows and 4 columns
        ACGT Human
        ACGC Chicken
        ACGG Mouse

        There is also a reverse argument, so if you wanted to sort by ID
        but backwards:

        >>> align1.sort(reverse=True)
        >>> print(align1)
        DNAAlphabet() alignment with 3 rows and 4 columns
        ACGG Mouse
        ACGT Human
        ACGC Chicken
