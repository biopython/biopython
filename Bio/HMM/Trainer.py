"""Provide trainers which estimate parameters based on training sequences.

These should be used to 'train' a Markov Model prior to actually using
it to decode state paths. When supplied training sequences and a model
to work from, these classes will estimate parameters of the model.

This aims to estimate two parameters:

- a_{kl} -- the number of times there is a transition from k to l in the
  training data.
- e_{k}(b) -- the number of emissions of the state b from the letter k
  in the training data.
