    Note: for BLASTX, the query sequence is shown as a protein sequence,
    but the numbering is based on the nucleotides.  Thus, the numbering
    is 3x larger than the number of amino acid residues.  A similar effect
    can be seen for the sbjct sequence in TBLASTN, and for both sequences
    in TBLASTX.

    Also, for negative frames, the sequence numbering starts from
    query_start and counts down.
