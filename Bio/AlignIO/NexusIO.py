"""Bio.AlignIO support for the "nexus" file format.

You are expected to use this module via the Bio.AlignIO functions (or the
Bio.SeqIO functions if you want to work directly with the gapped sequences).

See also the Bio.Nexus module (which this code calls internally),
as this offers more than just accessing the alignment or its
sequences as SeqRecord objects.
