"""Perform two-point crossovers between the genomes of two organisms.

This module performs two-point crossover between two genomes.
There are two flavors: OnePointCrossover (Point) and TwoPointCrossover.

TwoPointCrossover is the minimal crossover technique that
facilitates diverse genome length.  Do not use this if you need to
maintain consistent genome length.

TwoPointCrossover:
genome 1 --       A B*C D E F
genome 2 --       a b c*d e f

new genome 1 --   A B d e f
new genome 2 --   a b c C D E F
