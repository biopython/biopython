This module provides code to work with the enzyme.dat file from
Enzyme.
http://www.expasy.ch/enzyme/

Tested with the release of 03-Mar-2009.

Functions:

    - read       Reads a file containing one ENZYME entry
    - parse      Reads a file containing multiple ENZYME entries

Classes:

    - Record     Holds ENZYME data.
