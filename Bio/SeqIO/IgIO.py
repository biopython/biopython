"""Bio.SeqIO support for the "ig" (IntelliGenetics or MASE) file format.

This module is for reading and writing IntelliGenetics format files as
SeqRecord objects.  This file format appears to be the same as the MASE
multiple sequence alignment format.

You are expected to use this module via the Bio.SeqIO functions.

    handle - input file

    The optional free format file header lines (which start with two
    semi-colons) are ignored.

    The free format commentary lines at the start of each record (which
    start with a semi-colon) are recorded as a single string with embedded
    new line characters in the SeqRecord's annotations dictionary under the
    key 'comment'.
