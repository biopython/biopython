"""Bio.SeqIO support for the "tab" (simple tab separated) file format.

You are expected to use this module via the Bio.SeqIO functions.

The "tab" format is an ad-hoc plain text file format where each sequence is
on one (long) line.  Each line contains the identifier/description, followed
by a tab, followed by the sequence.  For example, consider the following
short FASTA format file:

>ID123456 possible binding site?
CATCNAGATGACACTACGACTACGACTCAGACTAC
>ID123457 random sequence
ACACTACGACTACGACTCAGACTACAAN

Apart from the descriptions, this can be represented in the simple two column
tab separated format as follows:

ID123456(tab)CATCNAGATGACACTACGACTACGACTCAGACTAC
ID123457(tab)ACACTACGACTACGACTCAGACTACAAN

When reading this file, "ID123456" or "ID123457" will be taken as the record's
.id and .name property.  There is no other information to record.

Similarly, when writing to this format, Biopython will ONLY record the record's
.id and .seq (and not the description or any other information) as in the
example above.
