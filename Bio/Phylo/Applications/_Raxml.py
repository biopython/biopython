class RaxmlCommandline(AbstractCommandline):
    """Command-line wrapper for the tree inference program RAxML.

    The required parameters are 'sequences' (-s), 'model' (-m) and 'name' (-n).
    The parameter 'parsimony_seed' (-p) must also be set for RAxML, but if you
    do not specify it, this wrapper will set the seed to 10000 for you.

    Example:

    >>> from Bio.Phylo.Applications import RaxmlCommandline
    >>> raxml_cline = RaxmlCommandline(sequences="Tests/Phylip/interlaced2.phy",
    ...                                model="PROTCATWAG", name="interlaced2")
    >>> print(raxml_cline)
    raxmlHPC -m PROTCATWAG -n interlaced2 -p 10000 -s Tests/Phylip/interlaced2.phy

    You would typically run the command line with raxml_cline() or via
    the Python subprocess module, as described in the Biopython tutorial.
