"""Draw representations of organism chromosomes with added information.

These classes are meant to model the drawing of pictures of chromosomes.
This can be useful for lots of things, including displaying markers on
a chromosome (ie. for genetic mapping) and showing syteny between two
chromosomes.

The structure of these classes is intended to be a Composite, so that
it will be easy to plug in and switch different parts without
breaking the general drawing capabilities of the system. The
relationship between classes is that everything derives from
_ChromosomeComponent, which specifies the overall interface. The parts
then are related so that an Organism contains Chromosomes, and these
Chromosomes contain ChromosomeSegments. This representation differents
from the canonical composite structure in that we don't really have
'leaf' nodes here -- all components can potentially hold sub-components.

Most of the time the ChromosomeSegment class is what you'll want to
customize for specific drawing tasks.

For providing drawing capabilities, these classes use reportlab:

http://www.reportlab.com

This provides nice output in PDF, SVG and postscript.  If you have
reportlab's renderPM module installed you can also use PNG etc.
