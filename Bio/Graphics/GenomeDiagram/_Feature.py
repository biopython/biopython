class Feature(object):
    """ Class to wrap Bio.SeqFeature objects for GenomeDiagram

        Provides:

        Methods:

        o __init__(self, parent=None, feature_id=None, feature=None,
                 color=colors.lightgreen) Called when the feature is
                 instantiated

        o set_feature(self, feature) Wrap the passed feature

        o get_feature(self) Return the unwrapped Bio.SeqFeature object

        o set_color(self, color) Set the color in which the feature will
                be drawn (accepts multiple formats: reportlab color.Color()
                tuple and color.name, or integer representing Artemis color

        o get_color(self) Returns color.Color tuple of the feature's color

        o __getattr__(self, name) Catches attribute requests and passes them to
                the wrapped Bio.SeqFeature object

        Attributes:

        o parent    FeatureSet, container for the object

        o id        Unique id

        o color    color.Color, color to draw the feature

        o hide      Boolean for whether the feature will be drawn or not

        o sigil     String denoting the type of sigil to use for the feature.
                    Currently either "BOX" or "ARROW" are supported.

        o arrowhead_length  Float denoting length of the arrow head to be drawn,
                            relative to the bounding box height.  The arrow shaft
                            takes up the remainder of the bounding box's length.

        o arrowshaft_height  Float denoting length of the representative arrow
                             shaft to be drawn, relative to the bounding box height.
                             The arrow head takes the full height of the bound box.

        o name_qualifiers   List of Strings, describes the qualifiers that may
                    contain feature names in the wrapped Bio.SeqFeature object

        o label     Boolean, 1 if the label should be shown

        o label_font    String describing the font to use for the feature label

        o label_size    Int describing the feature label font size

        o label_color  color.Color describing the feature label color

        o label_angle   Float describing the angle through which to rotate the
                    feature label in degrees (default = 45, linear only)

        o label_position    String, 'start', 'end' or 'middle' denoting where
                    to place the feature label. Leave as None for the default
                    which is 'start' for linear diagrams, and at the bottom of
                    the feature as drawn on circular diagrams.

        o label_strand  Integer -1 or +1 to explicitly place the label on the
                    forward or reverse strand. Default (None) follows th
                    feature's strand. Use -1 to put labels under (linear) or
                    inside (circular) the track, +1 to put them above (linear)
                    or outside (circular) the track.

        o locations     List of tuples of (start, end) ints describing where the
                    feature and any subfeatures start and end

        o type      String denoting the feature type

        o name      String denoting the feature name

        o strand    Int describing the strand on which the feature is found
