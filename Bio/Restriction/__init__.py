from Bio.Restriction.Restriction import *  # noqa (legacy module arrangement)


#
#   OK can't put the following code in Bio.Restriction.__init__ unless
#   I put everything from Restriction in here.
#   or at least the RestrictionBatch class.
#
#   The reason for that is if I do that, I break the __contains__ method of
#   the RestrictionBatch in Restriction, which expect to find the name of
#   the enzymes in the locals() dictionary when evaluating string to see if
#   it is an enzyme.
#
#   This call for some explanations I guess:
#       When testing for the presence of a Restriction enzyme in a
#       RestrictionBatch, the user can use:
#
#           1) a class of type 'RestrictionType'
#           2) a string of the name of the enzyme (it's repr)
#               i.e:
#                   >>> from Bio.Restriction import RestrictionBatch, EcoRI
#                   >>> MyBatch = RestrictionBatch(EcoRI)
#                   >>> #!/usr/bin/env python
#                   >>> EcoRI in MyBatch        # the class EcoRI.
#                   True
#                   >>>
#                   >>> 'EcoRI' in MyBatch      # a string representation
#                   True
#
#   OK, that's how it is suppose to work. And I find it quite useful.
#
#   Now if I leave the code here I got:
#                   >>> from Bio.Restriction import RestrictionBatch, EcoRI
#                   >>> MyBatch = RestrictionBatch(EcoRI)
#                   >>> EcoRI in MyBatch # the class EcoRI.
#                   True
#                   >>> 'EcoRI' in MyBatch   # a string.
#                   False

#   There is 5 ways to change that:
#       1) abandon the evaluation of string representation.
#       2) leave the code like that and hack something in RestrictionBatch.
#       3) Move back the code in Bio.Restriction.Restriction
#       4) Move RestrictionBatch here.
#       5) Remove Restriction.Restriction and move all the code in here
#
#   1) no fun in that.
#   2) there is a simpler way to do it.
#   3) I prefer to keep all the code together.
#   4) and 5) both are OK. Only a matter of preference.
#
#   So the following code has been moved back to Bio.Restriction.Restriction
#   For the user the results is transparent:
#   from Bio.Restriction import * works as before.
#

# ##
# ##   The restriction enzyme classes are created dynamically when the module is
# ##   imported. Here is the magic which allow the creation of the
# ##   restriction-enzyme classes.
# ##
# ##   The reason for the two dictionaries in Restriction_Dictionary
# ##   one for the types (which will be called pseudo-type as they really
# ##   correspond to the values that instances of RestrictionType can take)
# ##   and one for the enzymes is efficiency as the bases are evaluated
# ##   once per pseudo-type.
# ##
# ##   However Restriction is still a very inefficient module at import. But
# ##   remember that around 660 classes (which is more or less the size of Rebase)
# ##   have to be created dynamically. However, this processing take place only
# ##   once.
# ##   This inefficiency is however largely compensated by the use of metaclass
# ##   which provide a very efficient layout for the class themselves mostly
# ##   alleviating the need of if/else loops in the class methods.
# ##
# ##   It is essential to run Restriction with doc string optimisation (-OO switch)
# ##   as the doc string of 660 classes take a lot of processing.
# ##
# # CommOnly    = RestrictionBatch()    # commercial enzymes
# # NonComm     = RestrictionBatch()    # not available commercially
# # for TYPE, (bases, enzymes) in typedict.items():
# #    #
# #    #   The keys are the pseudo-types TYPE (stored as type1, type2...)
# #    #   The names are not important and are only present to differentiate
# #    #   the keys in the dict. All the pseudo-types are in fact RestrictionType.
# #    #   These names will not be used after and the pseudo-types are not
# #    #   kept in the locals() dictionary. It is therefore impossible to
# #    #   import them.
# #    #   Now, if you have look at the dictionary, you will see that not all the
# #    #   types are present as those without corresponding enzymes have been
# #    #   removed by Dictionary_Builder().
# #    #
# #    #   The values are tuples which contain
# #    #   as first element a tuple of bases (as string) and
# #    #   as second element the names of the enzymes.
# #    #
# #    #   First eval the bases.
# #    #
# #    bases = tuple(eval(x) for x in bases)
# #    #
# #    #   now create the particular value of RestrictionType for the classes
# #    #   in enzymes.
# #    #
# #    T = type.__new__(RestrictionType, 'RestrictionType', bases, {})
# #    for k in enzymes:
# #        #
# #        #   Now, we go through all the enzymes and assign them their type.
# #        #   enzymedict[k] contains the values of the attributes for this
# #        #   particular class (self.site, self.ovhg,....).
# #        #
# #        newenz = T(k, bases, enzymedict[k])
# #        #
# #        #   we add the enzymes to the corresponding batch.
# #        #
# #        #   No need to verify the enzyme is a RestrictionType -> add_nocheck
# #        #
# #        if newenz.is_comm() : CommOnly.add_nocheck(newenz)
# #        else : NonComm.add_nocheck(newenz)
# ##
# ##   AllEnzymes is a RestrictionBatch with all the enzymes from Rebase.
# ##
# # AllEnzymes = CommOnly | NonComm
# ##
# ##   Now, place the enzymes in locals so they can be imported.
# ##
# # names = [str(x) for x in AllEnzymes]
# # locals().update(dict(map(None, names, AllEnzymes)))
# ##
# ##   Limit what can be imported by from Restriction import *
# ##   Most of the classes here will never be used outside this module
# ##   (Defined,Palindromic...). It is still possible to request them specifically
# ##
# ##   also delete the variable that are no longer needed.
# ##
# ##
# # __all__=['Analysis', 'RestrictionBatch','AllEnzymes','CommOnly','NonComm']+names
# # del k, x, enzymes, TYPE, bases, names
