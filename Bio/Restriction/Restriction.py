"""Restriction Enzyme classes.

Notes about the diverses class of the restriction enzyme implementation::

            RestrictionType is the type of all restriction enzymes.
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            AbstractCut implements some methods that are common to all enzymes.
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            NoCut, OneCut,TwoCuts   represent the number of double strand cuts
                                    produced by the enzyme.
                                    they correspond to the 4th field of the
                                    rebase record emboss_e.NNN.
                    0->NoCut    : the enzyme is not characterised.
                    2->OneCut   : the enzyme produce one double strand cut.
                    4->TwoCuts  : two double strand cuts.
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Meth_Dep, Meth_Undep    represent the methylation susceptibility to
                                    the enzyme.
                                    Not implemented yet.
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Palindromic,            if the site is palindromic or not.
            NotPalindromic          allow some optimisations of the code.
                                    No need to check the reverse strand
                                    with palindromic sites.
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Unknown, Blunt,         represent the overhang.
            Ov5, Ov3                Unknown is here for symmetry reasons and
                                    correspond to enzymes that are not
                                    characterised in rebase.
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Defined, Ambiguous,     represent the sequence of the overhang.
            NotDefined
                                    NotDefined is for enzymes not characterised
                                    in rebase.

                                    Defined correspond to enzymes that display
                                    a constant overhang whatever the sequence.
                                    ex : EcoRI. G^AATTC -> overhang :AATT
                                                CTTAA^G

                                    Ambiguous : the overhang varies with the
                                    sequence restricted.
                                    Typically enzymes which cut outside their
                                    restriction site or (but not always)
                                    inside an ambiguous site.
                                    ex:
                                    AcuI CTGAAG(22/20)  -> overhang : NN
                                    AasI GACNNN^NNNGTC  -> overhang : NN
                                         CTGN^NNNNNCAG

                note : these 3 classes refers to the overhang not the site.
                   So the enzyme ApoI (RAATTY) is defined even if its
                   restriction site is ambiguous.

                        ApoI R^AATTY -> overhang : AATT -> Defined
                             YTTAA^R
                   Accordingly, blunt enzymes are always Defined even
                   when they cut outside their restriction site.
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Not_available,          as found in rebase file emboss_r.NNN files.
            Commercially_available
                                    allow the selection of the enzymes
                                    according to their suppliers to reduce the
                                    quantity of results.
                                    Also will allow the implementation of
                                    buffer compatibility tables. Not
                                    implemented yet.

                                    the list of suppliers is extracted from
                                    emboss_s.NNN

#   The restriction enzyme classes are created dynamically when the module is
#   imported. Here is the magic which allow the creation of the
#   restriction-enzyme classes.
#
#   The reason for the two dictionaries in Restriction_Dictionary
#   one for the types (which will be called pseudo-type as they really
#   correspond to the values that instances of RestrictionType can take)
#   and one for the enzymes is efficiency as the bases are evaluated
#   once per pseudo-type.
#
#   However Restriction is still a very inefficient module at import. But
#   remember that around 660 classes (which is more or less the size of Rebase)
#   have to be created dynamically. However, this processing take place only
#   once.
#   This inefficiency is however largely compensated by the use of metaclass
#   which provide a very efficient layout for the class themselves mostly
#   alleviating the need of if/else loops in the class methods.
#
#   It is essential to run Restriction with doc string optimisation (-OO
#   switch) as the doc string of 660 classes take a lot of processing.
