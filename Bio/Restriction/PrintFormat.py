r"""Print the results of restriction enzyme analysis.

PrintFormat prints the results from restriction analysis in 3 different
format: list, column or map.

The easiest way to use it is:

    >>> from Bio.Restriction.PrintFormat import PrintFormat
    >>> from Bio.Restriction.Restriction import AllEnzymes
    >>> from Bio import Entrez
    >>> from Bio import SeqIO
    >>> handle = Entrez.efetch(db="nucleotide", rettype="fasta", id="SYNPBR322")
    >>> pBR322 = SeqIO.read(handle, "fasta")
    >>> handle.close()
    >>> dct = AllEnzymes.search(pBR322.seq)
    >>> new = PrintFormat()
    >>> new.print_that(dct, 'My pBR322 analysis:\n', 'No site:\n')
    My pBR322 analysis:
    AasI       :  2169, 2582.
    AatII      :  4289.
    ...
    ZraI       :  4287.
    ZrmI       :  3847.
    No site:
    AarI      AatI      Acc65I    AcsI      AcvI      AdeI      AflII     AgeI
    ...
    Vha464I   XapI      XbaI      XcmI      XhoI      XmaCI     XmaI      XmaJI
    Zsp2I
    >>> new.sequence = pBR322.seq
    >>> new.print_as("map")
    >>> new.print_that(dct)
    ...

Some of the methods of PrintFormat are meant to be overridden by derived
class.
