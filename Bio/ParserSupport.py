"""Code to support writing parsers (DEPRECATED).

Classes:
 - AbstractParser         Base class for parsers.
 - AbstractConsumer       Base class of all Consumers.
 - TaggingConsumer        Consumer that tags output with its event.  For debugging

Functions:
 - safe_readline          Read a line from a handle, with check for EOF.
 - safe_peekline          Peek at next line, with check for EOF.
 - read_and_call          Read a line from a handle and pass it to a method.
 - read_and_call_while    Read many lines, as long as a condition is met.
 - read_and_call_until    Read many lines, until a condition is met.
 - attempt_read_and_call  Like read_and_call, but forgiving of errors.
 - is_blank_line          Test whether a line is blank.
