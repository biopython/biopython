This module provides code to import KEGG Pathway maps for use with
the Biopython Pathway module.

The pathway maps are in the format:

RXXXXX:[X.X.X.X:] A + 2 B <=> C
RXXXXX:[X.X.X.X:] 3C <=> 2 D + E
...

where RXXXXX is a five-digit reaction id, and X.X.X.X is the optional
EC number of the enzyme that catalyze the reaction.
