    """Lowess smoother: Robust locally weighted regression.

    The lowess function fits a nonparametric regression curve to a scatterplot.
    The arrays x and y contain an equal number of elements; each pair
    (x[i], y[i]) defines a data point in the scatterplot. The function returns
    the estimated (smooth) values of y.

    The smoothing span is given by f. A larger value for f will result in a
    smoother curve. The number of robustifying iterations is given by iter. The
    function will run faster with a smaller number of iterations.

    x and y should be numpy float arrays of equal length.  The return value is
    also a numpy float array of that length.

    >>> import numpy
    >>> x = numpy.array([4,  4,  7,  7,  8,  9, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12,
