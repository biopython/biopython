"""Code for doing k-nearest-neighbors classification.

k Nearest Neighbors is a supervised learning algorithm that classifies
a new observation based the classes in its surrounding neighborhood.

Glossary:
 - distance   The distance between two points in the feature space.
 - weight     The importance given to each point for classification.

Classes:
 - kNN           Holds information for a nearest neighbors classifier.


Functions:
 - train        Train a new kNN classifier.
 - calculate    Calculate the probabilities of each class, given an observation.
 - classify     Classify an observation into a class.

Weighting Functions:
 - equal_weight    Every example is given a weight of 1.
