                    ’M’: Use linear mapping according to Zarringhalam et al.

                    adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for partition
                    function folding (partfunc). The option dangles0 ignores dangling ends altogether

                    stacking of adjacent helices in multi−loops. At the moment the implementation
                    will not allow coaxial stacking of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3
                    and works only for mfe folding.
