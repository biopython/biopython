     JATS Version 1.3 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                  (DAL/BTU) v1.3 (2021-06-10)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on June 10, 2021, so it supersedes all Committee 
     Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.3 2021 (the version
     submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.3 20210610 
     (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019).

     The file names and formal public identifiers have been 
     changed in the modules and the catalogs.

 35. JATS 'v1.3d2 20201130' becomes 'v1.3 20210610' 
     (final ANSI vote date)
     'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021'

   ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.3d2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.3d2 (2020-11-30)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. 
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     of the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
     testing. The formal public identifiers have been changed 
     in the modules and the catalogs.

 34. OBJECT ID Added <object-id> to: 
        <ref-list>
  
 33. EXPANSION OF FIXED ATTRIBUTES LIST: There are four   
     content-defined attributes which are CDATA values 
     (undetermined) in Archiving, but which are named value 
     lists in Publishing/Authoring:
       - @fn-type 
       - @person-group-type (override is in this module)
       - @pub-id-type
       - @ref-type 
     In order to give users of Publishing and Authoing
     more flexibility to name new values without 
     destroying the benefit of named value lists:
       - A new value “custom” has been added to the named
           value list of each of these four attributes.
       - A new attribute @custom-type has been added to
           each element that takes one of these attributes.
     The new attribute @custom-type was also added to
     Green, so that documents valid to Blue or Pumpkin 
     would also be also valid to Green.
     In this module:
      - The element <person-group> was given the new 
        attribute @custom-type. The value "custom" will be
        documented as a valid person-group type.
        As an example: 
           <person-group @person-group-type=”custom” 
                         custom-type=”statisticians”>
     The Best Practice rule (unenforceable in DTDs, but  
     enforceable in Schematron) is, that if you use the 
     value “custom” from one of these lists, you should 
     also record what type of 'custom' in the 
     @custom-type attribute.
     
 32. JATS "v1.3d2 20201130" becomes 'v1.3 20210610' (second 
     committee draft following the final ANSI/NISO 1.2 vote)

 28. PUB-ID-TYPE - @pub-id-type changed back to a fixed list from 
     CDATA, reversing the decision of Version 1.2d1. Although 
     the value list is unchanged, best practice will be documented
     as using @pub-id-type for type and @assigning-authority

 19. ATTRIBUTES FOR PUB-ID
   - Added the linking attributes (optional version) to <pub-id> , 
     so that a <pub-id> that is a DOI, for example, can carry the 
     linking attributes and be made into a live link. In this use
     of <pub-id>, the element is acting both as an identifier
     and as a link.
   - Added new attribute @assigning-authority to <pub-id>, to
     carry new values such as "CrossRef" and to take some of the
     semantic burden off the '@pub-id-type' attribute, when
     values are organizations such as "Genbank" or "PDB".
 
 18. VERSION FOR DATASETS - Added new element <version>
     for citing datasets and software. Similar to <edition>
     for printed material.
 
 17. DATA TITLE FOR DATASETS - Added new element <data-title>
     to name datasets and parts of datasets. Acts both as an
     <article-title> equivalent and as a <source> equivalent,
     since many levels of data may be cited.

 16. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/

 15. ACCESS DATE ELEMENT
     Added attributes for @calendar and @iso-8601-date. The element is
     deprecated but still in use.

 14. NEW <era> ELEMENT
     Added <era> through date-parts.class to:
      - <date-in-citation>

 13. INSTITUTIONS TO STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS
     Added the elements <institution-wrap> to the following elements
     through the institution-wrap.class:
      - <std-organization>

 12. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/
   
 11. EDITION 
       a) Changed the long name of the <edition> element
          ("Edition, Cited)") to "Edition Statement, Cited" to
          indicate that element MAY contain more than just the
          edition number.
       b) Changed the definition of <edition> to include the full
          edition statement and not just the edition number.
       c) Added new element @designator to hold the edition
          number, since the definition of edition is changing.
          (through %edition-atts).
   
 10. DATE IN CITATION ATTRIBUTES - Added to the attributes for
     <date-in-citation> (through @date-in-citation-atts):
       a) ISO 8601 standard date format attribute (@iso-8601-date) 
          Format  YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss 
       b) Name of the calendar used (@calendar), to hold values
          such as "Gregorian", "Japanese" (Emperor years), or
          "Islamic".
   
  9. STANDARD ORGANIZATION - Added new element for the name of
     the standards body that created or that promulgates a
     standard. <std-organization> may be used as part of the
     description of a cited standard inside a citation.
     (New PEs: std-organization-atts; std-organization-elements)
   
  8. STANDARD MODEL - Updated the model for <std>, the description
     of a cited standard in side a citation to include several
     elements:
         - <source> contains the name of the standard
         - <pub-id> contains the standard designator
         - date elements <month>, <day>, and <year> name the 
              official date
         - <std-organization> (new element) names the standards 
             body
         - <named-content> takes anything else a publisher/archive 
             wishes to record, such as the standard status, et al.
      The following elements were retained form the older model
      and so will also be allowed inside <std:>

         - <styled-content> because archives cannot always know the
             reason behind a typographic change
         - the emphasis elements (all face markup)
         - <sub> and <sup>
   
 7.  Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
     public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  6. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  5. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

  4. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
     @xml:lang to the following elements:
      - access-date through access-date-atts (only @specific-use)
      - annotation through annotation-atts (both)
      - chapter-title through chapter-title-atts (both) NEW PE
      - comment through comment-atts (both)
      - date-in-citation through date-in-citation-atts (both)
      - edition through edition-atts (both)
      - gov through gov-atts (both)
      - note through note-atts (both)
      - part-title through part-title-atts (both) NEW PE
      - patent through patent-atts (both)
      - person-group through person-group-atts (both)
      - pub-id through pub-id-atts (@specific-use only)
      - ref through ref-atts (both)
      - ref-list through ref-list-atts (@specific-use only)
      - series through series-atts (both)
      - source through source-atts (@specific-use only;
          @xml:lang already)
      - std through std-atts (both)
      - time-stamp through time-stamp-atts (@specific-use only)
      - trans-source through trans-source-atts (@specific-use only;
          @xml:lang already)

  3. PERSON GROUP - Changed the model of <person-group> to mixed
     content. This entailed: creating new PE %person-group-elements;
     that contained the elements to be used and Changing PE
     %person-group-model to (#PCDATA %person-group-elements;)*.
     The PE person-group-model has been retained in this module for
     compatibility, but has been set to the mixed model using
     person-group-elements.

  2. ANNOTATION - Changed to content model to use the parameter
     entity %annotation-model; Content model unchanged.

     =============================================================

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.
