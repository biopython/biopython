     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/

  8. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base to every element, whether 
     metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.

  7. ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS ON NEW STRUCTURES
     - Added <abstract> (through %abstract.class;) and <kwd-group> 
       (through %kwd-group.class;) to the following elements:
        - app (through %sec-model;)
        - app-group (through %app-group-model;)

     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/
  
  6. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
