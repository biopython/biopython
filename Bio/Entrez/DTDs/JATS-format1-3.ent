  12. RUBY MODEL CHANGED TO MATCH HTML5
      - changed the Ruby content model to allow only a single
        Ruby annotation on a single Ruby base:
            (rb, rt+)
        The Ruby textual annotation may NOT take a pair of
        Ruby parentheses. This is a simplification of the
        HTML5 model:
           (rb, (rt | (rp, rt, rp)) )
        The simplification does not allow Ruby parenthesis.
        Archiving and BITS both use the full model above.

  11. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/

 10. RUBY ANNOTATIONS - Added new elements for:
      - <ruby> The Ruby wrapper element, which contains the base
          text and the annotation.
      - <rb> Ruby Base text, acts in the same manner as face markup,
        surrounding some text in the narrative.
      - <rt> Ruby Text, the annotation that modifies a piece of
         the narrative text, frequently typeset above the text.

  9. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.
     This added a new attribute list to:
      - break 
      - hr      
      - rp               

  8. ADDED NEW ELEMENT <fixed-case> 
     - defined as meaning that the case of the content is not to
       change, even if the content around it is styled to all
       upper case or all lower. For example "PhD".

  7. ADDED NEW ATTRIBUTE - @toggle added to:
     - bold, italic (default="yes"), monospace, overline, 
       roman (default="no"), sans-serif, sc, strike, and underline.

  6. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal

     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  5. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  4. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

<!--                    A Ruby textual annotation is an annotation,
                        typically short, applied to a letter, word,
                        phrase, or name that appears in the narrative
                        text. Ruby annotations can indicate,
                        for example, pronunciation advice, notes for 
                        translation, semantic annotations, et al.
                          The <ruby> element is an inline wrapper  
                        element that contains some of the document 
                        narrative text (inside a Ruby Base <rb> 
                        element) and one or more Ruby textual 
                        annotations (inside <rt> elements) that are
                        associated with the base text.
                          In display or print, the characters of the
                        Ruby annotation are frequently placed above 
                        the characters they modify, in parenthesis 
                        after the characters they modify, or to the
                        right of vertically set text.
