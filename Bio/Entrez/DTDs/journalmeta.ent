Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)     
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  5. PUBLISHER - Moved element here from this module to the
     %common.ent; module since Book DTD also needed it and was 
     not including this module. 
     
  4. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
     the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now,
     -  %journal-meta-model; 

  3. CUSTOM METADATA - Added the new <custom-meta> element, its
     components, and its wrapper. This element is used to insert
     name/value pairs for metadata elements that are in source
     material but were never envisioned by this DTD. Allowed this
     element at the end of <journal-meta>.

  2. FPI - Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830" 

     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)
     
  1. Created element <journal-title> and added it to parameter 
     entity %journal-meta-model;  
     Rationale: To include full name of journal as part of 
     journal metadata.
                                                                   -->
