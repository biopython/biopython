     JATS Version 1.3 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                  (DAL/BTU) v1.3 (2021-06-10)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on June 10, 2021, so it supersedes all Committee 
     Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.3 2021 (the version
     submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.3 20210610 
     (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019).

     The file names and formal public identifiers have been 
     changed in the modules and the catalogs.

 55. JATS 'v1.3d2 20201130' becomes 'v1.3 20210610' 
     (final ANSI vote date)
     'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021'

  ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.3d2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.3d2 (2020-11-30)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. 
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     of the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
     testing. The formal public identifiers have been changed 
     in the modules and the catalogs.
         
 54. PROCESSING METADATA - A new container element was added as
     a child of <article>, <sub-article>, and <response> to 
     describe processing information to help determine the 
     exact tagset flavor used by this document instance. 
     (<processing-meta>)
     Current contents of <processing-meta>:
      - <restricted-by> - Names tighter schemas, subsets, or
           Guidelines followed by this document.
      - <extended-by> - Names extension or superset schemas
           followed by this document, such as TaxPub.
      - <custom-meta-group>
     Several new attributes were added to describe more 
     completely the flavor/version of JATS in which the 
     document was composed:
       - @tagset-family	 (JATS | BITS | STS)
       - @base-tagset    (Archiving | Publishing | Authoring)
       - @table-model	 (XHTML |OASIS-CALS | both | none)
       - @mathml-version (MathML 2.0 | MathML 3.0)
       - @dtd-version was also revised to be an optional
           value list (still on <article>)
       - math-representation - States the ways mathematical
            expressions appear in this document. Values are 
            an open, space-separated list, with values 
            probably one or more of the following words:
                mathml   tex   latex   images   plain-text 
            For example, both TeX and images (tex  images)
            For example, both MathML and TeX (mathml tex)
            Attribute order is irrelevant. For no math at 
            all, just skip this optional attribute.
  
 53. EXPANSION OF FIXED ATTRIBUTES LIST: There are four  
     content-defined attributes which are CDATA values 
     (undetermined) in Archiving, but which are named value 
     lists in Publishing/Authoring:
       - @fn-type 
       - @person-group-type
       - @pub-id-type (set up in this module)
       - @ref-type 
     In order to give users of Publishing and Authoing
     more flexibility to name new values without 
     destroying the benefit of named value lists:
       - A new value “custom” has been added to the named
           value list of each of these four attributes.
       - A new attribute @custom-type has been added to
           each element that takes one of these attributes.
     The new attribute @custom-type was also added to
     Green, so that documents valid to Blue or Pumpkin 
     would also be also valid to Green.
     In this module:
      - The element <article-id> was given the new 
        attribute @custom-type and "custom" was added to
        %pub-id-types (defined in the common module).
     The Best Practice rule (unenforceable in DTDs, but  
     enforceable in Schematron) is, that if you use the 
     value “custom” from one of these lists, you should 
     also record what type of 'custom' in the 
     @custom-type attribute.                        
    
 52. ISSUE SUBTITLE - Added <issue-subtitle> to 
     <issue-title-group> optional and repeatable

 51. ADDED ISSUE TITLE GROUP container element, for associating
     issue titles, subtitles, and translated titles, when there
     is more than one <issue>.

 50. ADDED <issue-title-group> added to <article-meta>
     (optional, repeatable)

 49. ASSIGNING AUTHORITY - Added @assigning-authority to the
     following elements, so that the type-of-identifier and
     the party-responsible-for-identifier could both be
     recorded.     
        - <self-uri>
        - <pub-date>
 
 48. JATS "v1.3d2 20201130" becomes 'v1.3 20210610' (second 
     committee draft following the final ANSI/NISO 1.2 vote)

   ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.3d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.3.d1 (2019-08-31)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. 
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     of the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.

 47. ASSIGNING AUTHORITY - Added @assigning-authority to the
     following elements, so that the type-of-identifier and
     the party-responsible-for-identifier could both be
     recorded.     
        - article-id
        - article-version
        - award-id
        - compound-kwd
        - compound-subject
        - kwd 
        - kwd-group
        - nested-kwd
        - subject
        - subject-group
        - unstructured-kwd-group
        - Note: <pub-id> already had @assigning-authority
 
 46. JATS "1.2" becomes "v1.3d1 20190831" (first committee
     draft following the final ANSI/NISO vote)
    ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.2     (2019-02-08)
    
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the both the NISO and ANSI membership 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on Feb 08, 2019, so it supersedes all Committee 
     Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.2 2018 (the version
     submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.2 20190208 
     (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021).
  
 45. JATS "1.2" becomes "v1.2 20190208" (final ANSI vote date)
     "ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015" becomes "ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019"
     
   ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2018)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.2     (2018-11-30)
    
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the both the NISO and ANSI membership 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI and NISO vote, so it supersedes all Committee Drafts
     and becoming NISO JATS 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2018).
  
 44. JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401" became
     JATS "1.2" and "v1.2 20181130" 

    =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.2d2  (2018-04-01)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     BITS is under continuous maintenance, and is modified at the
     discretion of the working group.
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.
  
 43. PUB-ID-TYPE - @pub-id-type changed back to a fixed list from 
     CDATA, reversing the decision of Version 1.2d1. Although 
     the value list is unchanged, best practice will be documented
     as using @pub-id-type for type and @assigning-authority
     for the responsible agency.
       - for <article-id>

 42. ASSIGNING AUTHORITY - Added @assigning-authority to the
     following elements, so that the type-of-identifier and
     the party-responsible-for-identifier could both be
     recorded. Previously, these values were both assigned to
     the attribute @pub-id-type.
         - <article-id>

 41. NON-MONETARY SUPPORT - Inside <article-meta> added new
     <support-group> to hold both funding and
     non-monetary support descriptions. <support-group> is 
     both a peer to <funding-group> (backward compatibility)
     and contains <funding-group>.
 
 40. PUBLICATION DATE-NOT-AVAILABLE - Inside <article-meta>, 
     <front-stub>, <event>, and <event-desc>
     added new element <pub-date-not-available>, as an 
     alternative to <pub-date>. The meaning is that a 
     publication date was (for whatever reason) not available. 
     Presence of the element says nothing about publication 
     status.
   
 39. VOCABULARY/TAXONOMY ATTRIBUTES - Added 2 new attributes for
     naming (and possibly linking to) general or controlled
     taxonomy, vocabulary, index, database or other source of
     terms (@vocab, and @vocab-identifier) to these
     elements (which could already take the attributes
     @vocab-term and @vocab-term-identifier):
        - <kwd>
        - <compound-kwd>
        - <nested-kwd>
        - <subject>
        - <compound-subject>

 38. BITS "2.0" and "v2.0 20151225" remains unchanged
   
     JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20171231" became
     JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401". 

     No module names were changed.
 
    =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.2d1  (2017-12-31)

     JATS Version 1.2d1              (DAL/BTU) v1.2d1  (2017-06-31)

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.

 36. EVENTS - 
      - Added <event>, which will reside only inside
        <pub-history>. 
      - Added <pub-history> to hold <event>s. Unlike in BITS, 
        <pub-history> will contain ONLY <event>s.
      - Took <event> attributes from BITS. 
      - Added <article-version> to model of <event>.
  
 35. PUB-ID-TYPE - @pub-id-type changed from a fixed list to
     CDATA for all usages of the attribute.

 34. ARTICLE META MODEL
     - NO DATE - <pub-date> (optional repeatable) is now
       followed by the optional new element 
       <pub-date-not-available>. 

     - ARTICLE VERSION - Added new element <article-version>
       inside <article-meta> to hold one version number for  
       the article. <article-version> element may repeat inside
       new element <article-version-alternatives> to hold 
       version numbers for this article from different systems.
 
     - PUBLICATION HISTORY - Added new element based on BITS,
       <pub-history>, to hold <event>s as <history> holds
       <date>s. New internal elements: <event>, <event-desc>
   
 33. VOCABULARY/TAXONOMY ATTRIBUTES - Added 4 new attributes for
     naming (and possibly linking to) a general or controlled
     taxonomy, vocabulary, index, database or other source of
     terms: @vocab, @vocab-identifier, @vocab-term, and
     @vocab-term-identifier

      - Attributes @vocab and @vocab-identifier were 
        added to the elements:
        - <kwd-group>
        - <subj-group>
        - <unstructured-kwd-group>

      - Attributes @vocab-term and @vocab-term-identifier were
        added to the elements:
        - <kwd>
        - <compound-kwd>
        - <nested-kwd>
        - <subject>
        - <compound-subject>
 
 32. JATS became version "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20170631"

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, so the formal public 
     identifiers were changed in the modules and the catalogs.
     No model or attribute changes were made at this time. 
 
 31. JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"
     BITS remained version "2.0" but becomes "v2.0 20151225"

     License and Indicators Recommended Practice.

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d3 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
     
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.

     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.
 
 29. <VOLUME> INSIDE <ARTICLE-META>

   - Allowed <volume> to repeat inside <article-meta>, the types to 
     be distinguished using @content-type

   - Added new optional element <volume-issue-group> inside 
     <article-meta) following all volume and issue elements
     to hold volume-issue pairs (or n-tuples) when a second
     and subsequent <volume> has its own related issue
     information.

   - Made <issue> repeatable, for those who choose not to use
     the new wrapper element.
   
 28. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"

     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/

 27. NEW <era> ELEMENT
     Added <era> through date-model
      - <pub-date>

 26. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.
     This added a new attribute list to:
      - article-categories
      - article-meta
      - counts
      - history
      - title-group                          

 25. ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS
       Changed "abstract*" to "(%abstract.class;)*"
       and "kwd-group*" to "(%kwd-group.class;)*" since those
       classes now exist. Elements should have a limited number of
       ways to be invoked.
        - article-meta (through %article-meta-model;)

     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/
   
 24. RELATED OBJECT - Added <related-object> everywhere
     <related-article> was used, including inside 
     <article-meta> using article-meta-model.

 23. CONTRIB-GROUP AND CONTRIB MODULE SHIFT - Moved <contrib>
     and <contrib-group> to common.ent, since they are now used
     in both article metadata and journal metadata.

 22. CONTRIBUTOR MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to the beginning
     at the <contrib> model, to hold identifiers for people,
     such as publishers-specific IDs, ORCIDs, and JST and NII 
     identifiers.
   
 21. COUNTS - Generic <count> element added to the <counts>
     wrapper. This element is allowed to repeat, to count
     anything a publisher or archive may wish to count.
     The @count-type attribute will name what is being counted
     (such as figures, tables, sections, contributors, images,
     etc.) The @count attribute will state how many of the 
     objects are in the document.
     
     Although a publisher or archive could choose to label
     all the counted objects in a document this way, the
     specific count elements (fig-count, equation-count,
     word-count, etc.) will be retained for backwards
     compatibility.
     
     New parameter entities: count-atts.
   
 20. PUBLICATION DATE ATTRIBUTES - Added to the attributes for
     <pub-date> (through @pub-date-atts):
       a) @iso-8601-date - ISO 8601 standard date format
          of the publication date. Format  YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss 
       b) @calendar - Name of the calendar used (@calendar) in
          naming this publication date (such as "Gregorian", 
          "Japanese" (Emperor years), or "Islamic").
       c) @date-type to record lifecycle information as to which
          publication date is involved (such as retracted, corrected,
          preprint).
       d) @publication-format to hold what format or media was 
          published on this date (such as "print" or
          "electronic").
       e) @xml:lang (comments below said was this added for 0.4).
   
 19. COMPOUND KEYWORD PARTS - Allowed the individual compound 
     keyword parts (<compound-kwd-part> to be as complex as 
     ordinary keywords <kwd>), by giving them the same model 
     as <kwd>.
   
 18. NESTED KEYWORDS - Added new keyword type element for nested
     keywords (<nested-kwd>), to hold hierarchical keywords such
     as taxonomic structures. New PEs %nested-kwd-model  and
     %nested-kwd-atts 
   
 17. MODULE MOVEMENT (from increased reference content)

     a) Element <degrees> - Moved <degrees> and its parameter
        entities from this module from JATS-common.ent.
   
     b) Element <supplement> - Moved <supplement> and its parameter
        entities from this module from JATS-common.ent.
   
     c) Element <conf-sponsor> - Moved <conf-sponsor> and its parameter
        entities from this module from JATS-common.ent.
   
     d) Element <on-behalf-of> - Moved <on-behalf-of> and its parameter
        entities from this module from JATS-common.ent.
   
 16. Added name comment to %counts-model;

 15. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
     public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
 14. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
 13. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.

 12. UNSTRUCTURED KEYWORD GROUP ATTRIBUTES - Made
     %unstructured-kwd-group-atts; into its own PE, as
     documentation stated had already been done.

 11. KEYWORD ATTRIBUTES - To make the tag set more consistent,
     added @content-type to <kwd>, since <compound-kwd> already
     took this attribute. Through %kwd-atts;

 10. I18N - At the request of the SBJ Working Group (Japan)
     made <series-text> repeatable inside <article-categories> using
     %article-categories-model;

  9. TITLE ELEMENTS - Removed the dependency which had both
     <subtitle> and <alt-title> modeled with the same parameter
     entity %title-elements;. Created new PEs for each element
     but set them (as the default) to %title-elements so that no
     customization would break. Models changed:
       - alt-title    %alt-title-elements; defined in common.ent
       - subtitle     %subtitle-elements; (moved to this
           module)

  8. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
     to <article-meta> through %article meta-model;. This element
     will hold multiple <aff>s that are a representation of a
     single affiliation, for example, the name of an institution
     in two languages or two scripts.

  7. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
     @xml:lang to the following elements:
      - alt-title through alt-title-atts (both)
      - article-id through article-id-atts (@specific-use only)
      - author-comment through author-comment-atts (both)
      - author-notes through author-notes-atts (both)
      - article-id through article-id-atts (@xml:lang)
      - contrib through contrib-atts (@specific-use only)
      - contrib-group through contrib-group-atts (@xml:lang)
      - corresp through corresp-atts (@specific-use)
      - degrees through degrees-atts (both)
      - kwd-group through kwd-group-atts (@specific-use only
             @xml:lang already there)
      - on-behalf-of through on-behalf-of-atts (both) NEW PE
      - product through product-atts (both)
      - pub-date through pub-date-atts (@xml:lang)
      - self-uri through self-uri-atts (both)
      - series-text through series-text-atts (both)
      - series-title through series-title-atts (both)
      - string-conf through string-conf-atts (both)
      - subj-group through subj-group-atts (both)
      - subtitle through subtitle-atts (@specific only
             @xml:lang already there)
      - supplement through supplement-atts (both)

  6. TITLE ELEMENTS - Removed the dependency which had both
     <subtitle> and <alt-title> modeled with the same parameter
     entity %title-elements;. Created new PEs for each element
     but set them (as the default) to %title-elements so that no
     customization would break.

  5. COUNT ATTRIBUTES - Removed the dependency which had all of
     the count elements using a single attribute list (%count-atts;)
     Created new attributes list PEs for each of them: equation-count,
     fig-count, page-count, ref-count, table-count, and word-count.
     *****Customization Alert: New parameter entities could break
     some customizations. Check the attribute list parameter entity
     for each of the count elements. *****

  4. COMPOUND SUBJECT - Created a new element <compound-subject>
     that acts just like <compound-kwd>, in that it takes one or
     more <compound-subject-part>s to allow a complex, multi-
     part subject to be captured. New elements, attribute lists,
     and parameter entities. (An example of a compound subject
     is a code with a textual keyword (A11 Permeability).
     Allowed <compound-subject> as an alternative to <subject>
     inside a <subj-group>.

  3. SERIES TEXT ATTRIBUTES - Both <series-title> and
     <series-text> used to use the PE %series-title-atts;. Added the
     PE %series-text-atts;, which is the only one <series-text>
     uses. No documents need change.
     *****Customization Alert: New parameter entity could break some
     customizations. Check your <series-text> attributes. *****

  2. TRANSLATED ABSTRACT ATTRIBUTES - Both <abstract> and
     <trans-abstract> used to use the PE %abstract-atts;. Added the
     PE %trans-abstract-atts;, which is the only one <trans-abstract>
     uses. No documents need change.
     *****Customization Alert: New parameter entity could break some
     customizations. Check your <trans-abstract> attributes. *****

     =============================================================

                        element may also be used. If it is useful to
                        record both the code and the term, they can

                        or online generated Table of Contents. The
                        @content type attribute should be used to
                        indicate the type of part ("text", "code",
                        "sponsor", etc.).

<!--                    GROUPING ARTICLES IN SERIES
                        Series (as used in the <series-title> and
                        <series-text> elements described below) is
                        used in two different senses. Some issues of
                        journals are part of a series and will have
                        series information just as they have an
                        issue number as part of the article metadata,
                        to describe the issue of the journal in which
                        the article is published.  The second usage
                        is for groupings of articles within one
                        issue of a journal. For example, in some
                        journals, articles are grouped into a
                        series such as "From the Cover" and
                        identified as part of a series.
                        The Series Title element names the series
                        and the Series Text element provides textual
                        description (if any) describing the series.-->

                        complicated:
                         - a code and a term
                         - an abbreviation and its expansion

                           the parts of its hierarchy (as index
