Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-07-30)
     
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  3. LOOSENING ALL PHRASE-LEVEL ELEMENT USAGE - As part of the
     version 2.0 split into 3 DTDs, removed the distinctions
     between where phrase-level elements may be used. Now, if
     you can use one phrase-level, you can use them all. This
     allows any in any order. Phrase-level elements include the
     address elements (which is only a little odd for <addr-line>).
     
     The New Parameter Entity is %all-phrase; used inside:
       - %inside-cell;
     as well as inside the following inline mixes:
       - %emphasized-text;
       - %just-rendition;
       - %rendition-plus;
       - %simple-phrase;
       - %simple-text;
            
  2. REGULARIZING CLASS/MIX NAMES AND USAGE 

     a. MODIFY INLINE PARAMETER MIXES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Changed the inline-mix Parameter Entities to use the 
        OR-bar-first mechanism. This requires changing not
        only the Parameter Entity, but all content models that
        use the entity.
        - %emphasized-text; (used in most of the format elements)
        - %simple-phrase; 
        - %simple-text; 
        The following PEs were already in OR-bar-first form and were
        not changed:
        - %just-rendition;
        - %rendition-plus;
  
     b. RENAME EXISTING MIXES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Rename all general-purpose mixes whose named ended in the 
        suffix "-elements", since that suffix is reserved for mixes 
        that are mixed with #PCDATA for a particular element
        -  %doc-back-matter-elements; ==> %doc-back-matter-mix;
        -  %sec-back-matter-elements; ==> %sec-back-matter-mix;
        
     c. RENAME EXISTING CLASSES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Some classes did not have the ".class" suffix in their
        names. Changed the names to add the class suffix.
        - %block-math.class; used in 
             - %p-elements;
             - %inside-cell;
        - %inline-math.class; used in -%all-phrase;


     d.  MODIFIED %doc-back-matter-mix; (formerly named
         %doc-back-matter-elements;
         ### Customization Alert ###
         Corrected the historical error that had this Parameter 
         Entity calling a mix (-%sec-level;) and not a class 
         (-%sec.class);. Since there was nothing in -%sec-level; 
         but <sec>, this has no effect on blue or green but may 
         change existing customizations.

<!--                    This Parameter Entity contains all of the
                        phrase-level elements in the entire
                        Archival Tag Set EXCEPT THE <x> AND
                        <break> elements.
                        This change is as a result of the version
                        2.0 of the DTDs splitting into three.
                        The restrictions in the phrase-level content 
                        models were in place to help regularize the
                        archive. They have no place in a more
                        descriptive, open archival DTD. The cleanest
                        way to accomplish this is to relax the
                        fairly clean class/mix structure that the
                        DTD uses and do one layer of "onion" entities.
                          Thus the individual entities such as
                        %emphasized-text; will continue to exist,
                        but they will contain all the phrase-level
                        elements, through this Parameter Entity.
                        Developer's Note: At the moment, the <break>
                        and <x> elements are not included considered
                        to be "ordinary" phrase-level elements and
                        are not in %all-phrase;.
                        ### Usage Alert ###
                        Design Notes: 
                        1) Since this is used in other mixes,
                        unlike all other mixes, all-phrase must be 
                        declared first in this module. 
                        2) Since it acts  like a class (is used in
                        other mixes) it does not start with an 
                        OR bar, as all other inline mixes do       -->

                        as a <td> or <th> element in the XHTML table
                        model, the <entry> element in the OASIS CALS
                        table model, etc.  This PE will be used as the
                        value of %Flow.mix;, %paracon;, etc.
                        ### Usage Alert ###
                        Design Note: Inside cell is an exception, an
                        inline mix that does not start with an OR
                        bar. This is because is used within the
                        PE -%Flow.mix;, which is an inline mix
                        defined in the course of the XHTML Table DTD,
                        a DTD not under control of this DTD Suite. -->

                        not to contain any of these things.
                        Note that in the original, this contained
                        no math and no links, thus is was even
                        simpler than %simple-phrase; Now (v2 2004)
                        the two are the same.                      -->
