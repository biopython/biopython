     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/

  8. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.
 
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)

     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/
 
  7. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
     public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  6. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4"

     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

  4. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
     @xml:lang to the following elements:
       - private-char through private-char-atts (@specific-use)

  3. PEs FOR CONTENT MODELS - Added parameter entity redefinitions
     for the model of the <private-char> element.

  2. PEs FOR ATTLISTS - Added parameter entity redefinitions for the
     attribute lists of the following elements: (no attributes or
     values were changed)
       - glyph-ref         glyph-ref-atts
       - glyph-data        glyph-data-atts
       - private-char      private-char-atts

     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

<!--                    DESIGN COMMENT                             -->
<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--                    This DTD Suite has been designed with Unicode
                        as the basic representation of all special
                        characters. The use of combining characters
                        is supported and encouraged as is the use
                        of entities defined by the STIX project
                        (http://www.ams.org/STIX/). Unicode values
                        in planes other than Plane 0 may be freely
                        used.

                        Use of private publisher entities and Unicode
                        Private Use Area is discouraged, but supported
                        with the <private-char> element, for which a
                        corresponding bitmap must be submitted.

                        In cases where an entity name has been generally
                        accepted with a corresponding Unicode number
                        and the entity has not been added to
                        the ISO standard entity sets, a named entity
                        may be defined below (e.g. &euro;).

                        Because of the potential for conflicts in
                        assignments by different publishers,
                        the JATS DTD Suite does not support assignment 
                        of values in the Unicode Private Use Area.
                        Publishers who have defined characters in the
                        Private Use Area must remap those characters
                        to existing Unicode values (using combining
                        characters for special accented characters
                        where appropriate), or must submit bitmaps of
                        those characters using one of the two methods
                        supported under the <private-char> element.

                        Those custom publisher entities for which
                        corresponding Unicode values have not been
                        determined must be tagged with the
                        <private-char> element. Publishers must submit
                        bitmaps of those characters using one of the
                        two methods supported in the <private-char>
                        element.                                   -->

                        Special characters defined by publishers as

                        Area may not be deposited as is. If they

<!--                    PRIVATE CHARACTER (CUSTOM OR UNICODE)      -->
<!--                    A custom character entity defined by a
                        publisher or a custom character from the
                        Unicode private-use area for which a bitmap
                        is submitted for the glyph.

                        Since there are no completely standard/public
                        agreements on how such characters are to be
                        named and displayed, this technique is to be
                        used instead of a custom general entity
                        reference, to provide complete information
                        on the intended character.
                        A document should contain a <private-char>
                        element at each location where a private
                        character is used within the document. The
                        corresponding image for the glyph may be
                        given in the <glyph-data> element or as an
                        external bitmap file referenced by an
                        <inline-graphic> element.

                        Implementation Note: <inline-graphic> should
                        only be used outside <private-char> when the
                        graphic is something other than a special
                        character.

<!--                    GLYPH REFERENCE FOR A PRIVATE CHARACTER    -->
<!--                    Once a private character has been declared
                        using a <glyph-data> element, the character
                        can be reused by using this element to
                        point to the full <glyph-data> element.
                        The pointing uses the ID/IDREF mechanism,
                        using the "glyph-data" attribute of this
                        element to point to the "id" attribute of
                        another <glyph-data> element.
