     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
   ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.3 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                  (DAL/BTU) v1.3 (2021-06-10)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on June 10, 2021, so it supersedes all Committee 
     Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.3 2021 (the version
     submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.3 20210610 
     (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019).

     The file names and formal public identifiers have been 
     changed in the modules and the catalogs.

 41. JATS 'v1.3d2 20201130' becomes 'v1.3 20210610' 
     (final ANSI vote date)
     'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021'

  ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.3d2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.3d2 (2020-11-30)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. 
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     of the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
     testing. The formal public identifiers have been changed 
     in the modules and the catalogs.
         
 40. PROCESSING METADATA - A new container element was added as
     a child of <article>, <sub-article>, and <response> to 
     describe processing information to help determine the 
     exact tagset flavor used by this document instance. 
     (<processing-meta>)
     Current contents of <processing-meta>:
      - <restricted-by> - Names tighter schemas, subsets, or
           Guidelines followed by this document.
      - <extended-by> - Names extension or superset schemas
           followed by this document, such as TaxPub.
      - <custom-meta-group>
     Several new attributes were added to describe more 
     completely the flavor/version of JATS in which the 
     document was composed:
       - @tagset-family	(JATS | BITS | STS)
       - @base-tagset   (Archiving | Publishing | Authoring)
       - @table-model	(XHTML |OASIS-CALS | both | none)
       - @mathml		(MathML 2.0 | MathML 3.0)
       - @dtd-version was also revised (see below)

 39. DTD VERSION - The <article> attribute @dtd-version has been
     a #FIXED attribute for all of JATS history. This is very
     convenient when creating documents, but problematic for
     archives who receive many versions over time. If a document
     is valid to "v1.3d1"; it is also valid to the latest version
     and to all older versions. @dtd-version will stay a CDATA
     attribute, but will be optional, with a list of values, and
     with no default.
     
 38. ADDED <issue-title-group> added to <front-stub>
     (optional, repeatable)
 
 37. JATS "v1.3d2 20201130" becomes 'v1.3 20210610' (second 
     committee draft following the final ANSI/NISO 1.2 vote)

   ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.3d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.3.d1 (2019-08-31)

 36. QUESTION AND ANSWER MODULES - Added call to BITS question
     and answer module names question-answer ent
  
 35. JATS "1.2" becomes "v1.3d1 20190831" (first committee
     draft following the final ANSI/NISO vote) 

   ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.2     (2019-02-08)
    
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the both the NISO and ANSI membership 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on Feb 08, 2019, so it supersedes all Committee 
     Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.2 2018 (the version
     submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.2 20190208 
     (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021).
  
 34. JATS "1.2" becomes "v1.2 20190208" (final ANSI vote date)
     "ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015" becomes "ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019"

    ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2018)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.2     (2018-11-30)
    
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the both the NISO and ANSI membership 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI and NISO vote, so it supersedes all Committee Drafts
     and becoming NISO JATS 1.2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2018).
 
 33. @dtd-version becomes "1.2" from "1.2d2"
  
 32. JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401" became
     JATS "1.2" and "v1.2 20181130"

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     BITS is under continuous maintenance, and is modified at the
     discretion of the working group.
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.
 
 31. DATE-NOT-AVAILABLE - Inside <article-meta> and <front-stub>,
     a new element <pub-date-not-available> was added as an
     alternatives to <pub-date>. The meaning is that a 
     publication date was (for whatever reason) not available. 
     Presence of the element says nothing about publication 
     status.
 
 30. INLINE INDEX TERMS  - Added invocation to BITS inline
     (embedded) index term model
 
 29. @dtd-version becomes "1.2d2" from "1.2d1"

 28. JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20171231" became
     JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401". 

     No module names were changed. 
     
    =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2d1 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.2d2  (2017-12-31)

     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.
  
 27. JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20170631" became
     JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20171231". 

    =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2d1              (DAL/BTU) v1.2d1  (2017-06-31)

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed.

     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.

 26. xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation added to attribute list of
     <article>. Most modern processors do not need this, but
     a user with an older processor requested it, so the JATS
     Standing Committee acquiesced. This pseudo-attribute
     cannot be used with a DOCTYPE declaration.

 25. FRONT STUB MODEL
     - ARTICLE VERSION - Added new element <article-version>
       inside <front-stub> to hold one version number for the 
       article. <article-version> element may repeat inside
       <article-version-alternatives> to hold version numbers 
       from different systems.
 
     - NO DATE - <pub-date> (optional repeatable) is now
       followed by the optional new element 
       <pub-date-not-available>. 
 
     - PUB-HISTORY - <pub-history> (optional) added to hold
       <event>s.
   
 24. DTD version "1.2d1" from 1.1 

 23. JATS became version "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20170631"

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed.

19. <VOLUME> INSIDE <ARTICLE-META> and <FRONT-STUB>
   - Allowed <volume> to repeat inside <article-meta>, the types to 
     be distinguished using @content-type
   - Added new optional element <volume-issue-group> inside 
     <article-meta) following all volume and issue elements
     to hold volume-issue pairs (or n-tuples) when a second
     and subsequent <volume> has its own related issue
     information.

     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.1d2/
    
 17. MATHML 3.0 - Created a new version of the Archiving DTD to
     take MathML 3.0 instead of MathML 2.0.
     Nothing else changed from regular Archiving DTD.
     Call to MathML setup module changed and added call to the
     specific MathML 3.0 modules.
  
 16. DTD Version - Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.1d1" and 
     the formal public identifier to the date: "v1.1d1 20130915//EN".

 15. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new module for Common (global)
     attributes: %JATS-common-atts.ent;, called in before the
     customizations models module.

 14. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.
     This added a new attribute list to:
      - back
      - front
      - front-stub
                          
 13. ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS
       Changed "abstract*" to "(%abstract.class;)*"
       and "kwd-group*" to "(%kwd-group.class;)*" since those
       classes now exist. Elements should have a limited number of
       ways to be invoked.
        - article-meta (through %article-meta-model;)
        - front-stub (through %front-stub-model;)

     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/
   
 12. RELATED OBJECT - Added <related-object> everywhere
     <related-article> was used, including inside 
     <front-stub> using front-stub-model.
   
 11. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
     public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
 10. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  9. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

  8. BODY ATTRIBUTES - Added attribute list and new PE %body-atts;
     to the model of <body>. The only current attribute is
     @specific-use, which indicates, for example, not a real
     tagged XML body, but a 'bag of words" for indexing purposes.

  7. KEYWORD GROUP - Made <kwd-group> repeatable inside
     <front-stub> by modifying %front-stub-model;

  6. I18N - Changed the default for @xml:lang from "en" to
     #IMPLIED, so that the @xml:lang would inherit properly and
     not need to be over-ridden in
      - <sub-article> through %sub-article-atts;
      - <response> through %response-atts;

  5. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
     to <front-stub> through %front-stub-model;. This element
     will hold multiple <aff>s that are a representation of a
     single affiliation, for example, the name of an institution
     in two languages or two scripts.

  4. FRONT MATTER - Modified %front-model; to add the elements:
        ack | bio | fn-group | glossary (via %front.class;)
     to front matter content model.

  3. LANGUAGE CODES - Codes for languages as well as variants,
     transliterations, regions, scripts, and combinations
     such as "Jpan"(Han + Hiragana + Katakana). These values should be
     taken from RFC 5646/W3C/IANA Subtag Registry recommendations
     and can be found online at:
       http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

  2. Changed default @xml:lang from "EN" from "en" to match latest
     RFC 4646/W3C/IANA Subtag Registry recommendations

  1. Updated public identifier to "v3.0 20071031//EN"              -->

<!-- MODULAR DTD LIBRARY
                        A set of journal archiving and interchange
                        DTD modules was written as the basis for
                        publishing, interchange, and repository
                        DTDs, with the intention that DTDs for
                        specific purposes, such as this Journal
                        Archiving and Interchange DTD, would be
                        developed based on them.

                        This archiving DTD has been designed to
                        be descriptive, open, and inclusive to
                        allow journal articles to be translated into
                        this format as conveniently as possible
                        from a wide variety of proprietary journal
                        article DTDs (such as Blackwell, Keton, and
                        Ovid).

                        This Archiving DTD has been developed from
                        the JATS DTD Suite modules, in the approved 
                        manner, making changes to the declarations 
                        in those modules by over-riding Parameter 
                        Entity contents by redefining the entities 
                        in the:
                            %archivecustom-classes.ent;
                            %archivecustom-mixes.ent;
                            %archivecustom-models.ent;
                        modules, which are called from this DTD file.
                        No changes to any of the original JATS DTD
                        Suite modules are required in order to 
                        use this DTD.                              -->
