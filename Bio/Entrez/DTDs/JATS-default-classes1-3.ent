     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/
   
 16. CITATION ALTERNATIVES - Added a new element 
     <citation-alternatives> to the citation.class. The element
     will hold, for example, a single citation in multiple
     languages or a single citation tagged as a <mixed-citation>
     complete with punctuation and spacing and also as an
     <element-citation> with all punctuation and spacing removed.

 15. CONTRIBUTOR ID CLASS - Created a new class "contrib-id.class"
     to hold identifiers for people such as contributors such
     as <contrib> and <principal-investigator>s. This will hold
     publishers-specific IDs, ORCIDs, and JST and NII identifiers.

 14. NESTED KEYWORD CLASS - Created a new class "nested-kwd.class"
     to hold the kinds of keywords that can be used inside
     a nested keyword structure.
     
 13. COLLAB CLASS - Created a new class "collab.class" to hold 
     only the element <collab>, for use in the element
     <collab-alternatives>.

 12. COLLABORATION ALTERNATIVES - Added <collab-alternatives> to
     the name.class and -references.class to allow the
     <collab-alternatives> element to occur anywhere <collab> 
     was already used.
   
 11. STANDARDS CLASS - Created a new class "std.class" to hold all
     the elements inside the <std> element within citations.
   
 10. REFERENCES CLASS - Added <issn-l> to the class.
   
  9. NOTHING BUT PARA CLASS - Added a new %nothing-but-para.class;
     to get rid of PE clashes when the entity %just-para.class; needed
     to be expanded to include other elements. The nothing-but
     parameter entity contains <p> and only <p> and should never
     be changed in a customization. The infelicitously-named PE
     %just-para.class; can be modified for a customization to include
     other elements as well.

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  8. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  7. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.

  6. NEW CLASS FOR just <alt-text> %small-access.class;
     Since not everything needs a <long-desc>

  5. ALTERNATIVES - Added <private-char> so that the alternatives
     wrapper may be used to hold alternative characters, some as
     <private-char>, some as <textual-form>, some as <graphic>,
     etc.

  4. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
     to hold multiple <aff>s that are representations of a single
     affiliation, for example, the name of an institution in two
     languages or two scripts.
      -  contrib-info.class
      -  person-group-info.class
      -  Made a new class %aff-alternatives.class to hold just
         <aff> and <aff-alternatives> NEW PE

  3. NAME ALTERNATIVES - Added a new container element to hold
     alternate versions of a person's name, for example:
       -  a Roman alphabet transliteration, the Japanese characters,
          and the Japanese with Ruby annotations or
       -  the full peerage title of a person as well as a name
          that is just surname and given names
       -  a name and a sort version of the name that transliterates
          the diacritics (such as cedillas and umlauts) to the same
          character with no diacritic.
     a. This structure was added to name.class PE
     b. This structure was added to %investigator-name.class;
     c. This structure was added to %recipient-name.class;
     d. This structure was added to %references.class;

  2. ROLE - Added <role> to %person-group-info.class; thereby
     adding it to: <person-group> and <sig-block>

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.
