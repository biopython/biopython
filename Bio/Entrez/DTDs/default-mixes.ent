Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-07-30)
     
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  3. INLINE MATH CLASS - Added to everywhere %inline-display; was 
     including:
      - %simple-text; (via %all-phrase;)
      - %emphasized-text; (via %all-phrase;)
      
  2. PARAMETER ENTITY CLEANUP AND REGULARIZATION

     a. RENAME EXISTING CLASSES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Some classes did not have the ".class" suffix. Changed the 
        names to add the class suffix:
        - %block-math.class; used in 
           - %para-level;
           - %inside-cell; 
           - %inside-para; [now renamed -%p-elements;] 
        - %inline-math.class; used in 
           - %emphasized-text;
           - %inside-cell; 
           - %simple-phrase; and
           - %inside-para; [now renamed -%p-elements;])
 
     b. MODIFY PARA-LEVEL MIX
        ### Customization Alert ###
        New Parameter Entities in %para-level; (No model change.)
        - %para.class; is replaced by the combination of:
           - %just-para.class; and
           - %rest-of-para.class;

     c. LINK CLASSES
        - Replaced %link.class; with the following classes (no DTD 
          change):
           - %address-link.class;  (external links in addresses)
           - %article-link.class;  (links for journal article)
           - %simple-link.class;   (the internal links)
          in the following Parameter Entities:
            - %emphasized-text;
            - %inside-cell;
            - %p-elements;
            - %simple-phrase;
        - Deleted -%inpara-address; from -%inside-para;
          (which has been modified and renamed -%p-elements;) 
          (No DTD change, -%address-link.class; covers it.)

     d. INLINE PARAMETER MIXES
         ### Customization Alert ###
        Changed the inline-mix Parameter Entities to use the 
        OR-bar-first mechanism. This requires changing not
        only the Parameter Entity, but all content models that
        use the entity.
        - %emphasized-text; (used in most of the format
            elements)

     e. -ELEMENT AND -MODEL SUFFIXES
         ### Customization Alert ###
         RENAME ELEMENT MIXES NOT TO END IN "-elements", since that
         suffix is reserved for mixes that are added to #PCDATA for
         a particular element
         - %doc-back-matter-elements; ==> -%doc-back-matter-mix;
         - %sec-back-matter-elements; ==> -%sec-back-matter-mix;
         - Deleted the element mix "inside-para" and replaced it
           with "%p-elements;"
                
  1. Created this module as version "v2.0 20040830"                -->

                        example inside a Section
                        Note: There a major overlap between this
                        parameter entity and that for the elements
                        that are at the same level as a paragraph.
                        Inline elements appear only inside a 
                        paragraph, but block elements such as quotes 
                        and lists may appear either within a 
                        paragraph or at the same level as a 
                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a 
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material 
                        will have restricted such elements to only 
                        inside a paragraph,  some incoming material 
                        will have restricted them to only outside a 
                        paragraph and some may allow them in both
                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
                        be in either or both.                      -->

                        through PE redefinition can achieve. Some

                        and some have been set to #PCDATA plus the
                        other in an effort to allow designers to
                        modify entire groups of elements, but not
                        to change similar models individually .

                        This mix may be enhanced slightly in some
                        more permissive DTDs, and should always

                        DTD Maintenance Note: This Parameter Entity
                        and the related PE "Just-rendition" have
                        been put in place to restrict the amount of
                        variability that a person modifying the DTD
                        through PE redefinition can achieve. Some
                        elements have been set #PCDATA plus one PE
                        and some have been set to #PCDATA plus the
                        other in an effort to allow designers to
                        modify entire groups of elements, but not
                        to individually change similar models.
