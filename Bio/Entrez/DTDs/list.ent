Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  8. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
     the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now,
     as this is the most flexible system, allowing for
     #PCDATA, mixed, or element content. (This is in direct
     contrast to the "-element" suffixed models, which are
     designed to prohibit element content and permit only
     #PCDATA or mixed content.)
     -  %def-item-model;
     -  %def-list-model;
     -  %list-model;
     -  %list-item-model;

  7. PARAMETER ENTITY RENAMING
     a. ELEMENTS CHANGED TO MODELS
        ### Customization Alert ###
        There is a DTD naming convention that PEs which contain full
        content models are named with a "-model" suffix, in contrast 
        to OR-groups of elements which are added to #PCDATA 
        within a specific content model that are suffixed "-elements". 
        The few Parameter Entities that broke that pattern and were 
        renamed:
        - %def-item-elements;  ==> %def-item-model;       
        - %list-item-elements; ==> %list-item-model;       
      
     b. RENAME EXISTING CLASSES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Some classes did not have the ".class" suffix. Changed the 
        names to add the class suffix:
        - %block-math.class; (used in %term-elements;)

  6. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
     %default-classes.ent;
  
  5. Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830"

     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)

  4. Added ID attribute to element <def-item>. 
     Rationale: Provide unique identifier so <def-item> element 
     can be linked to. 

  3. Added element <label> to parameter entities %def-item-elements;
     and %list-item-elements; (now named %list-item-model;)
     Rationale: To provide <label> when needed for format 
     over-ride.

  2. Added new parameter entity %list-item-elements (now named
     %list-item-model;) to contain contents of <list-item>
     Rationale: In order to distinguish between models used by
     the Archiving DTD and the Publishing DTD, it was necessary 
     to create a parameter entity that could be overridden.

                        type of prefix character to be used before
                        each list item:
                          order - Ordered list. Prefix character is
                            a number or a letter, depending on
                            style
                          bullet - Unordered list. Prefix character
                            is a bullet, dash, or other symbol
                          alpha-lower - Ordered list. Prefix 
                             character is a lowercase alphabetical 
                             character
                          alpha-upper - Ordered list. Prefix 
                             character is an uppercase alphabetical 
                             character
                          roman-lower  - Ordered list. Prefix 
                             character is a lowercase roman 
                             numeral
                          roman-upper  - Ordered list. Prefix 
                             character is an uppercase roman 
                             numeral
                          simple - Simple or plain list (no prefix
                              character)
             prefix-word
                        Holds a word, such as "Step" or "Process"
                        that is to be added to each item of a list.
                        The word is in addition to any prefix
                        characters such as numbers or bullets,
                        and typically follows the prefix character.
                        For example, A list type of "1" and a
                        prefix word of "Step", would produce:
                        "Step 1. aaaa", "Step 2. bbbb", etc.
                        Note that the word is "Step" and not "Step ".
                        The odd man out is the unordered list,
                        type "2", which is the only case in which
                        the prefix character would precede the 
                        prefix word: - Step   - Step, but the
                        combination is not usually sensible.       
             list-content
                        There are some list models in use in journal
                        DTDs, where a specific named list has been
                        created instead of using <list> or <def-list>.
                        The "list content" attribute should be used 
                        to preserve the semantic information 
                        concerning such lists types.  Potential 
                        values include: "procedure", "where-list" 
                        (used in equations), "synonymy", 
                        "compound-info", "algorithm", "notation",
                        etc. For example, if a list were tagged as
                              <procedure>
                              <list-item>...</list-item>
                              </procedure>

             list-type  List prefix types.  Type describes the
                        type of prefix character to be used before
                        each list item:
                          order - Ordered list. Prefix character is
                            a number or a letter, depending on
                            style
                          bullet - Unordered list. Prefix character
                            is a bullet, dash, or other symbol
                          alpha-lower - Ordered list. Prefix 
                             character is a lowercase alphabetical 
                             character
                          alpha-upper - Ordered list. Prefix 
                             character is an uppercase alphabetical 
                             character
                          roman-lower  - Ordered list. Prefix 
                             character is a lowercase roman 
                             numeral
                          roman-upper  - Ordered list. Prefix 
                             character is an uppercase roman 
                             numeral
                          simple - simple or plain list (no prefix
                              character)
             prefix-word
                        Holds a word, such as "Step" or "Process"
                        that is to be added to each item of a list.
                        The word is in addition to any prefix
                        characters such as numbers or bullets,
                        and typically follows the prefix character.
                        For example, a list type of "1" and a
                        prefix word of "Step", would produce:
                        "Step 1. aaaa", "Step 2. bbbb", etc.
                        Note that the word is "Step" and not "Step ".
                        The odd man out is the unordered list,
                        type "2", which is the only case in which
                        the prefix character would precede the 
                        prefix word: - Step   - Step, but the
                        combination is not usually sensible.       
             list-content
                        There are some list models in use in journal
                        DTDs, where a specific named list has been
                        created instead of using <list> or <def-list>.
                        The "list content" attribute should be used 
                        to preserve the semantic information 
                        concerning such lists types.  Potential 
                        values include: "procedure", "where-list" 
                        (used in equations), "synonymy", 
                        "compound-info", "algorithm", "notation",
                        etc. For example, if a list were tagged as
                              <procedure>
                              <list-item>...</list-item>
                              </procedure>
                        that tagging could be preserved as:
                             <list list-content="procedure">
                              <list-item>...</list-item>
