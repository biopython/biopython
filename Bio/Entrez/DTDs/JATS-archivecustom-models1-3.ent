Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)
   ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.3 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                  (DAL/BTU) v1.3 (2021-06-10)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on June 10, 2021, so it supersedes all Committee 
     Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.3 2021 (the version
     submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.3 20210610 
     (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019).

     The file names and formal public identifiers have been 
     changed in the modules and the catalogs.

 53. JATS 'v1.3d2 20201130' becomes 'v1.3 20210610' 
     (final ANSI vote date)
     'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021'

  ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.3d2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.3d2 (2020-11-30)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. 
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     of the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
     testing. The formal public identifiers have been changed 
     in the modules and the catalogs.
     
 52. EXPANSION OF FIXED ATTRIBUTES LIST: There are four  
     content-defined attributes which are CDATA values 
     (undetermined) in Archiving, but which are named value 
     lists in Publishing/Authoring:
       - @fn-type 
       - @person-group-type (override is in this module)
       - @pub-id-type
       - @ref-type 
     In order to give users of Publishing and Authoing
     more flexibility to name new values without 
     destroying the benefit of named value lists:
       - A new value “custom” has been added to the named
           value list of each of these four attributes.
       - A new attribute @custom-type has been added to
           each element that takes one of these attributes.
     The new attribute @custom-type was also added to
     Green, so that documents valid to Blue or Pumpkin 
     would also be also valid to Green.
     In this module:
      - The element <article-id> was given the new attribute 
        @custom-type. The value "custom" will be
        documented as a valid article-id type.
       - The element <ref> was given the new attribute 
        @custom-type. The value "custom" will be
        documented as a valid reference type.
       - The element <pub-id> was given the new attribute 
        @custom-type. The value "custom" will be
        documented as a valid publication ID type.
    The Best Practice rule (unenforceable in DTDs, but  
     enforceable in Schematron) is, that if you use the 
     value “custom” from one of these lists, you should 
     also record what type of 'custom' in the 
     @custom-type attribute.    
     
 51. OBJECT ID Added <object-id> to: 
        <disp-formula>, <list>, <ref-list>

 50. SEE ALSO - The four vocabulary attributes were added to
     <see-also>, which is defined in the BITS question-answer
     model.

 49. STRING DATE - Used to be added to models using
     %citation-additions.class, now added through
     %references.class; and the same as Blue. Changed:
       <element-citation>, <mixed-citation>
       <product>, <related-article>, <related-object>

 48. ADDED <issue-title-group> added to <article-meta>
     (optional, repeatable)
 
 47. DISPLAY FORMULA - Held our noses and added <caption> to 
     <display-formula>.

 46. JATS "v1.3d2 20201130" becomes 'v1.3 20210610' (second 
     committee draft following the final ANSI/NISO 1.2 vote)

    =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.2d2  (2018-04-01)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     BITS is under continuous maintenance, and is modified at the
     discretion of the working group.
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.

 41. ASSIGNING AUTHORITY - Added @assigning-authority to the
     following elements, so that the type-of-identifier and
     the party-responsible-for-identifier could both be
     recorded. Previously, these values were both assigned to
     the attribute @pub-id-type.
        - <article-id>
        - Note: <pub-id> already had @assigning-authority

 40. NON-MONETARY SUPPORT - Inside <article-meta> added new
     <support-group> to hold both funding and
     non-monetary support descriptions. <support-group> is 
     both a peer to <funding-group> (backward compatibility)
     and contains <funding-group>.
 
 39. PUBLICATION DATE-NOT-AVAILABLE - Inside <article-meta>, 
     <front-stub>, <event>, and <event-desc>
     added new element <pub-date-not-available>, as an 
     alternative to <pub-date>. The meaning is that a 
     publication date was (for whatever reason) not available. 
     Presence of the element says nothing about publication 
     status.
 
 38. DATE IN CITATION - Superscript and subscript added to
     <date-in-citation>.
  
 37. CONFERENCE DATE - Face markup (face-markup.class) 
     added to <conf-date>.

 36. BITS "2.0" and "v2.0 20151225" remains unchanged
   
     JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20171231" became
     JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401". 

     No module names were changed.

 32. ARTICLE META MODEL
     - ARTICLE VERSION - Added new element <article-version>
       inside <article-metadata> to hold one version number for  
       the article. <article-version> element may repeat inside
       <article-version-alternatives> to hold version numbers 
       from different systems.
 
     - NO DATE - <pub-date> (optional repeatable) is now
       followed by the optional new element 
       <pub-date-not-available>. 
 
     - PUBLICATION HISTORY - Added new element based on BITS,
       <pub-history>, to hold <event>s as <history> holds
       <date>s. New internal elements: <event>, <event-desc>
       
 31. JATS became version "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20170631" 

    =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, so the formal public 
     identifiers were changed in the modules and the catalogs.
     No model or attribute changes were made at this time. 
 
 30. JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"
     BITS remained version "2.0" but becomes "v2.0 20151225"

     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d3             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d3  (2015-03-01)
   
     The changes in this release are in response to NISO 
     License and Indicators Recommended Practice.

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d3 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
     
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.

 29. JATS became version "1.1d3" and "v1.1d3 20150301"

     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2 (2014-09-30)
   
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
     
     This catalog represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.
 
 28.  RUBY MODEL CHANGED TO MATCH HTML5
      - changed the Ruby content model to allow only a single
        Ruby annotation on a single Ruby base:
            (rb, (rt | (rp, rt, rp)) )
        The Ruby textual annotation may take a pair of
        Ruby parentheses, but these are optional.

 27. ATTRIBUTES FOR PUB-ID
   - Added the linking attributes (optional version) to <pub-id> , 
     so that a <pub-id> that is a DOI, for example, can carry the 
     linking attributes and be made into a live link. In this use
     of <pub-id>, the element is acting both as an identifier
     and as a link.
   - Added new attribute @assigning-authority to <pub-id>, to
     carry new values such as "CrossRef" and to take some of the
     semantic burden off the '@pub-id-type' attribute, when
     values are organizations such as "Genbank" or "PDB".

 26. <OBJECT-ID> INSIDE <TRANS-ABSTRACT>
     Allowed <object-id> at the beginning of <trans-abstract>, 
     so that abstracts could be given DOIs.

 25. <VOLUME> INSIDE <ARTICLE-META>
   - Allowed <volume> to repeat inside <article-meta>, the types to 
     be distinguished using @content-type
   - Added new optional element <volume-issue-group> inside 
     <article-meta) following all volume and issue elements
     to hold volume-issue pairs (or n-tuples) when a second
     and subsequent <volume> has its own related issue
     numbers.
 
 24. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/

 23. NEW <era> ELEMENT
     Added <era> through date-parts.class to:
      - <conf-date>
      - <date-in-citation>
      - <pub-date>
      - <string-date>
      - access-date (deprecated
      - time-stamp (deprecated)

 22. INSTITUTIONS TO STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS
     Added the elements <institution-wrap> to the following elements
     through the institution-wrap.class:
      - <copyright-holder>
      - <std-organization>

 21. RUBY ANNOTATIONS - Overrode the default JATS inclusions, to
     change the more restricted face-markup class to the 
     Archive-specific all Phrase. Elements change:
      - <rb> Ruby Base (through %rb-elements;)

 20. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.

 19. ABSTRACTS AND KEYWORDS ON NEW STRUCTURES
     - Added <abstract> (through %abstract.class;) and <kwd-group> 
       (through %kwd-group.class;) to the following elements:
        - disp-formula (through %disp-formula-elements;)

     - Changed "abstract*" to "(%abstract.class;)*"
       and "kwd-group*" to "(%kwd-group.class;)*" since those
       classes now exist. Elements should have a limited number of
       ways to be invoked.
        - article-meta (through %article-meta-model;)
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/

 18. RELATED OBJECT - Added <related-object> everywhere
     <related-article> was used, including inside 
     <article-meta> using article-meta-model.

 17. CONTRIBUTOR MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to the 
     <contrib> model, to hold identifiers for people,
     such as publishers-specific IDs,  and ORCIDs.
   
 16. VERSE-LINE ELEMENTS - Added the PE %verse-line-elements to
     this module because the default expanded, and Archiving did
     not need to expand as it already was expanded.
   
 14. DATE ATTRIBUTES - Added attributes to <date> through @date-atts: 
       a) @iso-8601-date - ISO 8601 standard date format
          of the publication date. Format  YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss 
       b) @calendar - Name of the calendar used (@calendar) in
          naming this publication date (such as "Gregorian", 
          "Japanese" (Emperor years), or "Islamic").
       c) Added @publication-format, so that both publication
          dates and history dates can separate the format of the
          publication from the version/lifecycle event. Thus
          both an "article" and a "manuscript" might be received.
   
 13. STANDARDS ORGANIZATION - Added std-organization-elements
     to increase what was allowed in the names of standards bodies.

 12. XREF REF TYPES - #9 below says "XREF ATTRIBUTES - Removed 
     the %xref-atts PE from this module since the regular version 
     (in xlink3.ent(?)) was equally inclusive. But it is NOT. 
     Brought back %xref-atts;
   
 11. ISSN-L ELEMENTS - Added <x> TO <issn-l> via 
     %issn-l-elements;

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
 10. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  9. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.

  7. XREF ATTRIBUTES - Removed the %xref-atts PE from this module
     since the regular version (in xlink3.ent(?)) was equally 
     inclusive. See #12 above.

  6. ISSUE - Allowed to repeat inside <article-meta>

  5. AFFILIATION ALTERNATIVES - Added the element <aff-alternatives>
     to <article-meta> through %article meta-model;. This element
     will hold multiple <aff>s that are a representation of a
     single affiliation, for example, the name of an institution
     in two languages or two scripts.

  4. PERSON-GROUP - Became a mixed-content model, so the parameter
     entity %person-group-model: was changed to
     %person-group-elements;, which will be mixed with #PCDATA
     as defined in references.ent. The PE person-group-model has
     been retained in references.ent for compatibility, but has been
     set to the mixed model using person-group-elements.

  3. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
     @xml:lang to %display-atts;. Also added these attributes
     to the following over-rides:
      - article-id through article-id-atts (@specific-user only)
      - award-id through award-id-atts (both)
      - date through date-atts (@specific-use only)
      - funding-statement through funding-statement-atts (both)
      - pub-id through pub-id-atts (@specific-use only)
      - trans-title through pub-id-atts (@specific-use only;
         @xml:lang already)
      - xref through xref-atts (both)

  2. STRING-DATE - Added <string-date> back to the following
     elements using %citation-additions.class;. It was accidentally
     deleted during the 3.0 revision of -references.class:
      - product         (%product-elements;)
      - related-article (%related-article-elements;)
      - related-object  (%related-object-elements;)
      - funding-statement through funding-statement-atts (both)

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

                        Design Note: There is a major overlap between
                        this parameter entity and the mix for elements
                        that are at the same level as a paragraph.
                        Inline elements appear only inside a
                        paragraph, but block elements such as quotes
                        and lists may appear either within a
                        paragraph or at the same level as a
                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material
                        will have restricted such elements to only
                        inside a paragraph, some incoming material
                        will have restricted them to only outside a
                        paragraph and some may allow them in both
                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
                        be in either or both.                      -->
