<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--
     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  6. REGULARIZE USE OF CLASSES
     a. LINK CLASSES - Replaced %link.class; in the PE
        %named-content-elements; with the following classes 
        via inclusion of %all-phrase;
        (no DTD change, just reparameterization):
         - %address-link.class;   (links for journal article)
         - %article-link.class;   (links for journal article)
         - %simple-link.class;    (the internal links, same)
        
     b. NAMED CONTENT ELEMENTS - To make potential changes easier,
        replaced the Parameter Entity %emphasized-text; with its
        constituent classes
      
     c. RENAME EXISTING CLASSES
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Some classes did not have the ".class" suffix. Changed the 
        names to add the class suffix:
        - %block-math.class; (used in -%named-content-elements;)

     d. ABBREV - Changed content model to use new %def.class;

  5. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
     %default-classes.ent;
      
  4. Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830" 

     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)
  
  3. Added following parameter entities to the content model for
     <named-content>:
        - %block-display.class;
        - %block-math.class;
        - %emphasized-text;
        - %inline-display.class;
        - %list.class;
        - %rest-of-para.class;
     Rationale: To expand content model of <named-content> to 
     encompass most of the other phrase-level structures, which
     will allow preservation of phrase-level semantic information
     in content converted to this format.
     
  2. Added ID attribute to parameter entity %named-content-atts;  
     Rationale: Provide unique identifier so <named-content>
     element can be linked to. 
         
  1. Added ID attribute to element <abbrev>. 
     Rationale: Provide unique identifier so <abbrev> element 
     can be linked to. 
                                                                   -->
