   ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.3 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                  (DAL/BTU) v1.3 (2021-06-10)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on June 10, 2021, so it supersedes all Committee 
     Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.3 2021 (the version
     submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.3 20210610 
     (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019).

     The file names and formal public identifiers have been 
     changed in the modules and the catalogs.

 21. JATS 'v1.3d2 20201130' becomes 'v1.3 20210610' 
     (final ANSI vote date)
     'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021'

  ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.3d2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.3d2 (2020-11-30)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. 
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     of the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
     testing. The formal public identifiers have been changed 
     in the modules and the catalogs.
 
 20. EXPANSION OF FIXED ATTRIBUTES LIST: There are four   
     content-defined attributes which are CDATA values 
     (undetermined) in Archiving, but which are named value 
     lists in Publishing/Authoring:
       - @fn-type 
       - @person-group-type (override is in this module)
       - @pub-id-type
       - @ref-type 
     In order to give users of Publishing and Authoing
     more flexibility to name new values without 
     destroying the benefit of named value lists:
       - A new value “custom” has been added to the named
           value list of each of these four attributes.
       - A new attribute @custom-type has been added to
           each element that takes one of these attributes.
     The new attribute @custom-type was also added to
     Green, so that documents valid to Blue or Pumpkin 
     would also be also valid to Green.
     In this module:
      - The element <fn> was given the new attribute 
        @custom-type. The value "custom" will be
        documented as a valid footnote type.
        As an example: 
           <fn @fn-type=”custom” 
                         custom-type=”reading-level”>
     The Best Practice rule (unenforceable in DTDs, but  
     enforceable in Schematron) is, that if you use the 
     value “custom” from one of these lists, you should 
     also record what type of 'custom' in the 
     @custom-type attribute.                        


 19. JATS "v1.3d2 20201130" becomes 'v1.3 20210610' (second 
     committee draft following the final ANSI/NISO 1.2 vote)

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,

  6. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the

     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.

     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would

     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.

     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

  2. ACCESSIBILITY - Added @alt to <xref> through %xref-atts;
