     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on June 10, 2021, so it supersedes all Committee 
     Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.3 2021 (the version
     submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.3 20210610 
     (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019).

     The file names and formal public identifiers have been 
     changed in the modules and the catalogs.

     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed.

     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
     testing. The formal public identifiers have been changed 
     in the modules and the catalogs.

 26. AWARD GROUP - Added two new optional, non-repeatable elements:

        - <resource-id>
  
 22. JATS "1.2" becomes "v1.3d1 20190831" (first committee

 20. JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401" became
     JATS "1.2" and "v1.2 20181130" 

    =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.2d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.2d2  (2018-04-01)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     BITS is under continuous maintenance, and is modified at the
     discretion of the working group.
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting. The formal public identifiers were changed in the 
     modules and the catalogs.
  
 19. NON-MONETARY SUPPORT - Previous support descriptions in JATS
     used the <funding-group> element, which could only be used to
     describe monetary support for the research described in the
     article.
       Added new element <contributed-resource-group> to hold 
     descriptions of non-monetary support (such as data, facilities, 
     or any in-kind support) for the research described in the
     article.
     
     This changed the JATS models in several ways:
      - Inside <article-meta>, added a new element <support-group>
        to hold both <funding-group> and <contributed-resource-group>.
        For backwards compatibility, <support-group> is a 
        peer to <funding-group> inside <article-meta>, and (as the 
        path going forward) <support-group> also contains 
        <funding-group> as a child.
      - New elements inside <contributed-resource-group> (as its 
        children or descendants) include:
          - support-description
          - resource-group
          - resource-name
          - resource-wrap
          - resource-id
      - Inside <award-group>, added a new element <support-source>
        to describe the source of a non-monetary award. The
        element <support-source> is as an alternative to 
        <funding-source> (which describes the source of a monetary
        award).  
         
 18. AWARD ID ATTRIBUTES - Made the award-id attributes match 
     Green and BITS, adding @award-type and the might link
     attributes.
 
 17. BITS "2.0" and "v2.0 20151225" remain unchanged
   
     JATS "1.2d1" and "v1.2d1 20171231" became
     JATS "1.2d2" and "v1.2d2 20180401". 

     No module names were changed.

     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/

 11. INSTITUTION WRAP ADDED
     Added the elements <institution-wrap> to the following elements
     through the institution-wrap.class:
      - funding-source

 10. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.

  9. PRINCIPAL-AWARD-RECIPIENT MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to 
     the <principal-award-recipient> through 
     principal-award-recipient-elements, to hold identifiers for 
     people, such as publishers-specific IDs, ORCIDs, etc..

  8. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to 
     the <principal-investigator> through 
     principal-investigator-elements, to hold identifiers for

     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  6. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  5. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",

     new version number "0".
