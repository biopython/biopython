     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/

  5. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.
     This added an attribute list to:
      - floats-group
      - sec-meta
   
     =============================================================

     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/
   
  4. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
     public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

                        tables, text boxes, graphics, etc.) together

                        where they are referenced.
