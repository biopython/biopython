     JATS Version 1.3 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                  (DAL/BTU) v1.3 (2021-06-10)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by both the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. This version of the NISO JATS was approved 
     by ANSI vote on June 10, 2021, so it supersedes all Committee 
     Drafts as well as the draft version JATS 1.3 2021 (the version
     submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.3 20210610 
     (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019).

     The file names and formal public identifiers have been 
     changed in the modules and the catalogs.

 19. JATS 'v1.3d2 20201130' becomes 'v1.3 20210610' 
     (final ANSI vote date)
     'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2019' becomes 'ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021'

  ==============================================================
     JATS Version 1.3d2 (ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2021)
                                   (DAL/BTU) v1.3d2 (2020-11-30)
    
     ANSI NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, 
     which requires voting by the NISO and ANSI memberships 
     to be changed. 
      
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     of the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. This draft has not yet been given public review 
     or voting; it is for Standing Committee review and
     testing. The formal public identifiers have been changed 
     in the modules and the catalogs.

 18. TABLE CELLS - Added new elements to <td> using %inside.cell;
     and <entry> using %Flowmix;:
        <disp-quote>, <speech>, <statement>, <verse-group>
 
 17. JATS "v1.3d2 20201130" becomes 'v1.3 20210610' (second 
     committee draft following the final ANSI/NISO 1.2 vote)

   ===============================================================

 16. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

     - NEW PE for ANSWERS  - Added new mix "answer para level"
       to name the elements that may be used at the same
       structural level as a paragraph, when used inside an 
       <answer>. This rather awkward parameter entity was created
       to overcome the DTD determinism issues when using 
       <explanation> inside an <answer>. In order for 
       <explanation> to be used at the end of an answer, 
       it must not be allowed at the paragraph level
       inside <answer>.
     
     - INSIDE TABLE CELLS - Added the question answer class
       to the contents of table cell using inside cell mix.
  
 15. LINKING TABLES TO SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
 
     - Added the <xref> element (for an internal cross-reference)
       to the large OR-group inside the body of a <table-wrap>, to
       be used to make a link to a <supplementary-material>
       element as a way of recording that a dataset or similar is
       the data from which the table was derived.
        
 14. JATS "1.2" becomes "v1.3d1 20190831" (first committee
     draft following the final ANSI/NISO vote)

     submitted for vote), becoming NISO JATS v1.2 20190208

     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/

  6. PARAGRAPH IN TABLE CELL - Added <p> to the contents of
     table cells, through %inside-cell; (using
     %nothing-but-para.class;).
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/
   
  5. PARA-LEVEL PARAMETER ENTITY CONFLICT - Changed the parameter
     entity %para-level; to use the PE %nothing-but-para.class;,
     removing the similar PE "just-para.class;". It is possible to 
     add element(s) to %just-para.class;, so that the added element(s)
     may be used everywhere <p> is used. Such elements would also be
     named in %block-display.class;. This would lead to a conflict
     in %para-level; if both %just-para.class; and
     %block-display.class; named <p>. So %just-para.class; is replaced
     here in %para-level;. This is backward compatible for all XML
     documents. If a JATS customization has modified %just-para.class;
     they may need to change their customization to accommodate.
   
  4. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
     public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  3. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  2. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.

                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material
                        will have restricted such elements to only

                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
