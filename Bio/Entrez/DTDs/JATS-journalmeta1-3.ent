     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/

 10. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.
     This added a new attribute list to:
      - journal-meta
   
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/
   
  9. JOURNAL METADATA MODEL
     - Added <issn-l> as an optional element to <journal-meta>
     - Added contributors and affiliations to journal metadata through
       contrib-group.class (which resolves to <contrib-group>) and 
       aff-alternatives.class (which resolves to <aff> or
       <aff-alternatives>), using the journal-meta-model.

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  8. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  7. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

  6. I18N - Changed the default for @xml:lang from "en" to
     #IMPLIED, so that the @xml:lang would inherit properly and
     not need to be over-ridden in
      - <abbrev-journal-title> through %abbrev-journal-title-atts;
      - <journal-title> through %journal-title-atts;
      - <journal-subtitle> through %journal-subtitle-atts;

  5. JOURNAL METADATA- Added <notes> to repeat within <journal-meta>
     (through %journal-meta-model; and added @xml:lang and
     @specific-use to the attributes of <notes> through %notes-atts;

  4. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
     @xml:lang to the following elements:
      - abbrev-journal-title through abbrev-journal-title-atts
          (@specific-use-only; @xml:lang already)
      - journal-title through journal-title-atts
          (@specific-use-only;
      - journal-subtitle through journal-subtitle-atts
          (@specific-use-only)

  3. JOURNAL TITLE ELEMENTS - Removed the dependency which had both
     <journal-title> and <journal-subtitle> modeled with the same
     parameter entity %journal-title-elements;. Created new PE for
     %journal-subtitle-elements; but set it (as the default) to
     %journal-title-elements; so that no customization would break.

  2. SELF URI - Added <self-uri> to <journal-meta> (directly
     following <notes>) so that an XML document can point to the
     journal home page.
