Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

 14. OTHER-TABLE-WRAP-ATTS - Moved this Parameter Entity to the
     display module, so all variant DTDs could use it.

 13. LOOSENING ALL PHRASE-LEVEL ELEMENT USAGE - As part of the
     version 2.0 split into 3 DTDs, removed the distinctions
     between where phrase-level elements may be used. Now, if
     you can use one phrase-level, you can use them all. This
     allows any in any order. Phrase-level elements include the
     address elements (which is only a little odd for <addr-line>).
     
     New Parameter Entity is %all-phrase; used inside:
      - the Parameter Entities named "nnn-elements" that can
        be mixed with #PCDATA in the content model of the nnn
        element (for which the defaults are defined in the module 
        that holds the element, just before the element, and the
        over-rides are defined below.)
      - And the following content model over-rides:
        . %chem-struct-model; (via %chem-struct-elements;)
        . %copyright-statement-model; (renamed -elements)
        . %history-model; (via %history-elements)

 12. ACCESS CLASS
        ### Customization Alert ###
     a. Took <ext-link> out of -%access.class;. It did not belong.
        It belongs in -%address-link.class;
     b. Added -%address-link.class; to anywhere regular
        %access.class; was used.

 11. ATTRIBUTE VALUE LISTS - The Green (Archival) DTD needed to
     change all explicit attribute value lists in the DTD to CDATA. 
     In the future, explicit list types will be a feature of the
     Blue (Publishing) and new Authoring DTDs. Therefore, added
     Parameter Entities to hold the following attributes:
       - %date-atts; (date-type changed from list to CDATA)
       - %article-id-atts; (pub-id-type changed to CDATA)
       - %pub-id-atts; (pub-id-type changed to CDATA)
       - %xref-atts; (ref-type changed to CDATA)
     
 10. <x> GENERATED TEXT AND PUNCTUATION ELEMENT:
     a. Added to the following models:
        - %def-list-model;
        - %def-item-model;
        - %article-meta-model;
        - %person-group-model;
     b. Added to %contrib-model; and %contrib-group-model; 
        (via %x.class;)  
        (Therefore added to <contributor> and
         <contributor-group>)
     c. Also added to the element groups for:
        - %aff-elements;
        - %citation-elements;
        - %collab-elements;
        - %corresp-elements;
        - %product-elements;
        - %publisher-loc-elements;
        - %related-article-elements;

  9. OVER-RIDE OF ARTICLE-META-MODEL - Added new elements
     a. <custom-meta-wrap> containing <custom-meta>
     b. <email>
     c. <issue-id>
     d. <issue-title> (for special title or theme)
     e. <page-range>
     f. <volume-id>
     g. <license> (for now, just a bucket into which to
        dump license-related material until the AIT Workgroup
        does more analysis)

  8. DATES
     a. Made a new Parameter Entity %string-date-elements; to
        hold all the elements that may be mixed with #PCDATA
        in a <string-date>
     b. Used %date-parts.class; and %x.class; in 
           new %string-date-elements;

  7. PRODUCT AND RELATED ARTICLE
     Added reference elements to both

  6. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
     the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now,
     as this is the most flexible system, allowing for
     #PCDATA, mixed, or element content. (This is in direct
     contrast to the "-element" suffixed models, which are
     designed to prohibit element content and permit only
     #PCDATA or mixed content.) Added parentheses to Parameter
     Entity and removed them from the Element Declaration.
     -  %article-meta-model; 
     -  %contrib-group-model;
     -  %contrib-model;
     -  %def-item-model;
     -  %def-list-model; 
     -  %kwd-group-model; 

  5. CITATION MODEL / COPYRIGHT STATEMENT MODEL
     ### Customization Alert ###
     -  Replaced the Parameter Entity %citation-model; with the
        OR list Parameter Entity %citation-elements; and used that
        within the content model of <citation>
     -  Similar Change for copyright-statement-elements

  4. DEF-ITEM LOOSENING
     a. Made <term> optional and repeatable so that incomplete
        <def-item>s can be captured. 
     b. Added <x> to:
        - <def-list> by way of -%def-list-model;
        - <def-item> by way of -%def-item-model;
 
  3. RENAMED CLASSES
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Not all classes ended in the ".class" suffix. Changed the 
     following to add the class suffix:
     - %display-back-matter.class; used in -%preformat-elements;
     - %address-elements; (renamed -%address.class;!) used in:
          - %aff-elements; 
          - %corresp-elements; 
          - %publisher-loc-elements;
     - %contrib-info.class; used in -%contrib-group-model;
     - %block-math.class; used in 
          - %named-content-elements; 
          - %term-elements;
     - %rest-of-para.class;
          Inside the content model for Paragraph <p>, was renamed 
          %p-elements;. The content model for Named Content 
          and the model for %p-elements; still use
          %rest-of-para.class;.

  2. INLINE PARAMETER MIXES
     ### Customization Alert ###
     INLINE FORMULA/DISPLAY FORMULA/PREFORMAT/RELATED ARTICLE - 
     Changed the "-element" Parameter Entities to use the 
     OR-bar-first mechanism:
        - Inline Formula - In the PE %inline-formula-elements;
          Changed the PE "%all-phrase;" to "| %all-phrase;"  (Since
          the OR bar following the #PCDATA in the content model 
          had been changed to match.) 
        - Display Formula (%disp-formula-elements; 
             %disp-formula-model;)
        - Preformat Elements (%preformat-elements; %preformat-model;)
        - Related Article (%related-article-elements;)
                
  1. Created this module as version "v2.0 20040830"                -->

                        that are at the same level as a paragraph.
                        Inline elements appear only inside a 
                        paragraph, but block elements such as quotes 
                        and lists may appear either within a 
                        paragraph or at the same level as a 
                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a 
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material 
                        will have restricted such elements to only 
                        inside a paragraph, some incoming material 
                        will have restricted them to only outside a 
                        paragraph and some may allow them in both
                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
                        be in either or both.                      -->
