     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-08-30)
     
     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set 
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist 
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange 
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting 
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  3. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A MODEL 
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Added internal parentheses to Parameter Entity and removed 
     them from Element Declaration for:
     - %sec-model;

  2. DEFAULT CLASSES - Were moved from this module to 
     %default-classes.ent;
  
  1. Updated public identifier to "v2.0 20040830"

             xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
                        element is expressed.  Recommended best 
                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German). These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiations such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
                        (United States English). 
             sec-type   Conversion Note: This attribute may be used
                        to retain information on the semantic
                        content of a section where that is known.
                        Authoring Note: Top-level sections (those 
                        that are not nested inside other sections)
                        may be assigned a "type" attribute for 
                        indexing purposes. This attribute should be
                        used only if the section is one of the listed
                        types and should otherwise be omitted. A
                        section that contains content of more than 
                        one type should have the type IDs combined.
                        (e.g., "Materials and Methods" would be
                        type="materials|methods").  
                        Types values are:

             disp-level Sometimes in print or on screen, the display
                        or apparent hierarchical level of a section
                        is not the same as its real position in the
                        hierarchy.  For example, in some styles,
                        the "Clinical Finding" Section or the 
                        'Methodology" Section always looks like a 
                        particular level heading (say a level 2 head),
                        wherever it falls in the hierarchy (say a 
                        level 1 head or a level 3 head). This
                        attribute can be used to record the needed
                        display level. (Rare)                      -->
