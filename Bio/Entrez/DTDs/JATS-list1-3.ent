     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.3d2/

  8. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.
     This added a new attribute list to:
      - def-head
      - term-head

     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  6. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  5. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

  4. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
     @xml:lang to the following elements:

      - def-item through def-item-atts (both)
      - def-list through def-list-atts (@xml:lang-only;
          @specific-use already)
      - list through list-atts (@xml:lang-only; @specific-use already)
      - list-item through list-item-atts (both)
      - term through term-atts (both)

  3. DEFINITION LIST HEADS - Removed the dependency in which
     <term-head> and <def-head> both used the parameter entity
     %def-list-head-elements; One uses %term-head-elements; and
     the other uses %def-head-elements; But the
     %def-list-head-elements; was retained for backward
     compatibility.

  2. DEF LIST ATTRIBUTES - Removed the dependency whereby <def-list>
     used both %def-list-atts; and %list-atts;. <def-list> now uses
     only %def-list-atts; No documents need change.
     *****Customization Alert: New parameter entity could break some
     customizations. Check your <def-list> attributes.        *****
