"""Provides code to access NCBI over the WWW.

The main Entrez web page is available at:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/

A list of the Entrez utilities is available at:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/utils_index.html

Variables:
email        Set the Entrez email parameter (default is not set).
tool         Set the Entrez tool parameter (default is  biopython).

Functions:
efetch       Retrieves records in the requested format from a list of one or
             more primary IDs or from the user's environment
epost        Posts a file containing a list of primary IDs for future use in
             the user's environment to use with subsequent search strategies
esearch      Searches and retrieves primary IDs (for use in EFetch, ELink,
             and ESummary) and term translations and optionally retains
             results for future use in the user's environment.
elink        Checks for the existence of an external or Related Articles link
             from a list of one or more primary IDs.  Retrieves primary IDs
             and relevancy scores for links to Entrez databases or Related
             Articles;  creates a hyperlink to the primary LinkOut provider
             for a specific ID and database, or lists LinkOut URLs
             and Attributes for multiple IDs.
einfo        Provides field index term counts, last update, and available
             links for each database.
esummary     Retrieves document summaries from a list of primary IDs or from
             the user's environment.
egquery      Provides Entrez database counts in XML for a single search
             using Global Query.
espell       Retrieves spelling suggestions.

read         Parses the XML results returned by any of the above functions.
             Typical usage is:

             >>> handle = Entrez.einfo() # or esearch, efetch, ...
             >>> record = Entrez.read(handle)

             where record is now a Python dictionary or list.

parse        Parses the XML results returned by any of the above functions,
             returning records one by one.
             Typical usage is:

             >>> handle = Entrez.efetch(...) # or esummary, elink, ...
             >>> records = Entrez.parse(handle)
             >>> for record in records:
             ...     # each record is a Python dictionary or list.
             ...     print record

             This function is appropriate only if the XML file contains
             multiple records, and is particular useful for large files. 

_open        Internally used function.
