"""
The KD tree data structure can be used for all kinds of searches that
involve N-dimensional vectors. For example, neighbor searches (find all points
within a radius of a given point) or finding all point pairs in a set
that are within a certain radius of each other. See "Computational Geometry: 
Algorithms and Applications" (Mark de Berg, Marc van Kreveld, Mark Overmars, 
Otfried Schwarzkopf).
