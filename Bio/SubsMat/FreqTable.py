r"""A class to handle frequency tables or letter count files.

Example files for a DNA alphabet:

A count file (whitespace separated)::

 A  50
 C  37
 G  23
 T  58

The same info as a frequency file::

 A 0.2976
 C 0.2202
 G 0.1369
 T 0.3452

Functions:
  :read_count(f): read a count file from stream f. Then convert to
                  frequencies.
  :read_freq(f): read a frequency data file from stream f. Of course, we then
                 don't have the counts, but it is usually the letter frequencies
                 which are interesting.

Methods:
  (all internal)

Attributes:
  :alphabet: The IUPAC alphabet set (or any other) whose letters you are using.
             Common sets are: ``IUPAC.protein`` (20-letter protein), ``IUPAC.unambiguous_dna``
             (4-letter DNA). See ``Bio.Alphabet`` for more.
  :data: Frequency dictionary.
  :count: Count dictionary. Empty if no counts are provided.

Example of use:
    >>> import io
    >>> from Bio.SubsMat import FreqTable
    >>> f_count = io.StringIO(u"A  50\nC  37\nG  23\nT  58")
    >>> ftab = FreqTable.read_count(f_count)
    >>> for nb in sorted(ftab):
    ...     print("%s %0.4f" %(nb, ftab[nb]))
    ...
    A 0.2976
    C 0.2202
    G 0.1369
    T 0.3452
