	The nexml root element below is structured as follows:
		* there is a required version attribute. Additions where
		  the 'core' remains backward compatible are identified
		  by decimal increases (1.1, 1.2, etc.). Changes to the
		  core standard are identified by integer increases (2.0,
		  3.0, etc.). The former is somewhat likely to happen in
		  practice, the latter hopefully isn't.
		  
		* In some places in instance documents, snippets of schema
		  language code are necessary, for example to specify 
		  concrete subclasses. Such snippets are bound to the 
		  http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance namespace, and
		  by convention identified by the 'xsi' prefix.
		  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xsd
		  
		* to facilitate validation, the location of the schema is
		  specified in the root element. Such a specification is
		  done using the schema language snippet xsi:schemaLocation
		  
		* by convention, root elements of nexml fragments are 
		  pre-fixed with 'nex', which is bound to the namespace
		  http://www.nexml.org/1.0
		  	
		* the optional 'generator' attribute can be used to specify
		  which program wrote out the file.
		  
		* other xml namespaces (i.e. attributes with the 'xmlns'
		  prefix) can be specified here, in case they're used 
		  in child elements. For example, the xlink namespace
		  is used for links ('href' attributes, as in html), so
		  that child elements may contain links to other resources.

		The taxa element is analogous to the taxa block in nexus
		files. Like all elements that capture things that might
		need to be referred to elsewhere, it requires an 'id'
		attribute, whose value must consist of a string of alpha-
		numeric characters, starting with a letter. In addition,
		it may (optionally) have the following attributes:
			* 'label', a free form string, only meant for humans
			* 'xml:base', indicating the base url of the resource
			* 'xml:lang', indicating a two-letter language code
			* 'xml:id', a file-scope unique ID
			* 'xlink:href', a link to somewhere else
			* 'class', a vector of nexml id references pointing
			  to classes the element belongs to (this is analogous
			  to 'sets' in nexus, but using the xml idiom to do
			  the same thing).
