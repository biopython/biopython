"""Try out the N-queens problem for an arbitrary number of queens.

This program uses Genetic Algorithms to try to solve the N queens
problem, in which you place N different queens on an N by N chess
board such that no two queens will be attacking each other.

We represent queens on the board as a tuple like (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
which would be 5 queens diaganol across the board.

Usage:
python test_GAQueens.py <Number of Queens to place>

where <Number of Queens to place> is just a number specifying how many
queens you want to try to calculate this for.

When called as part of the Biopython unit test suite, 5 queens are used.
