CC   This Wikel tick colony was established in 1996 using field
CC   collected ticks from New York, Oklahoma and a Lyme Disease endemic
CC   area of Connecticut.  This colony has been continuously in-bred
CC   since establishment and has not been supplemented with field
CC   collected material.  The colony is known to be a competent vector
CC   of various Borrelia and Babesia isolates. Genomic DNA was prepared
CC   from embryonated eggs.
CC   The Ixodes scapularis Genome Project (IGP) is a community-based
CC   effort initiated in early 2004 to sequence the I. scapularis
CC   genome.  The IGP is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and
CC   Infectious Diseases (NIAID)/National Institute of Health as part of
CC   the NIAID-funded Microbial Sequencing Centers (MSCs) at The J.
CC   Craig Venter Institute (http://www.jcvi.org) and The Broad
CC   Institute (http://www.broad.mit.edu/).  The genome sequencing was
CC   performed at both MSCs and the assembly at JCVI. The sum of all
CC   reads equals 6X based on an estimated genome size of 2.1 Gbp, while
CC   the coverage on assembled contigs is 3.8X.  The scaffolds are
CC   comprised of 570637 contigs; the other 570958 contigs in the 01
CC   version of this project represent degenerate contigs that were not
CC   incorporated into scaffolds.  The annotation for this assembly will
CC   be produced jointly by the MSCs and VectorBase
CC   (http://www.vectorbase.org).  Data release and use follow NIAID
CC   guidelines
CC   (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/genomes/mscs/data_release.htm).
CC   VectorBase (www.vectorbase.org), a NIAID Bioinformatics Resource
CC   Center, is responsible for the long-term curation of the assembled
CC   genome sequence  and its annotation.  For more information, contact
CC   info@vectorbase.org.
CC   Assembly name: JCVI_ISG_i3_1.0
CC   Coverage: 3.8x on assembled contigs; 6x based on an estimated
CC   genome size of 2.1 Gbp
CC   Annotation was added to the scaffolds in December 2008.
