COMMENT     
            This Wikel tick colony was established in 1996 using field
            collected ticks from New York, Oklahoma and a Lyme Disease endemic
            area of Connecticut.  This colony has been continuously in-bred
            since establishment and has not been supplemented with field
            collected material.  The colony is known to be a competent vector
            of various Borrelia and Babesia isolates. Genomic DNA was prepared
            from embryonated eggs.
            
            The Ixodes scapularis Genome Project (IGP) is a community-based
            effort initiated in early 2004 to sequence the I. scapularis
            genome.  The IGP is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and
            Infectious Diseases (NIAID)/National Institute of Health as part of
            the NIAID-funded Microbial Sequencing Centers (MSCs) at The J.
            Craig Venter Institute (http://www.jcvi.org) and The Broad
            Institute (http://www.broad.mit.edu/).  The genome sequencing was
            performed at both MSCs and the assembly at JCVI. The sum of all
            reads equals 6X based on an estimated genome size of 2.1 Gbp, while
            the coverage on assembled contigs is 3.8X.  The scaffolds are
            comprised of 570637 contigs; the other 570958 contigs in the 01
            version of this project represent degenerate contigs that were not
            incorporated into scaffolds.  The annotation for this assembly will
            be produced jointly by the MSCs and VectorBase
            (http://www.vectorbase.org).  Data release and use follow NIAID
            guidelines
            (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/genomes/mscs/data_release.htm).
            
            VectorBase (www.vectorbase.org), a NIAID Bioinformatics Resource
            Center, is responsible for the long-term curation of the assembled
            genome sequence  and its annotation.  For more information, contact
            info@vectorbase.org.
            Assembly name: JCVI_ISG_i3_1.0
            Coverage: 3.8x on assembled contigs; 6x based on an estimated
            genome size of 2.1 Gbp
            Annotation was added to the scaffolds in December 2008.
