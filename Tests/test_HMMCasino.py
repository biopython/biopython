"""Test out HMMs using the Occasionally Dishonest Casino.

This uses the occasionally dishonest casino example from Biological
Sequence Analysis by Durbin et al.

In this example, we are dealing with a casino that has two types of
dice, a fair dice that has 1/6 probability of rolling any number and
a loaded dice that has 1/2 probability to roll a 6, and 1/10 probability
to roll any other number. The probability of switching from the fair to
loaded dice is .05 and the probability of switching from loaded to fair is
.1.
