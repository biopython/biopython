      deformability and contractility via cAMP-RhoA-ROCK axis in human breast cancer 
      cells.

AB  - The mechanical properties, or mechanotypes, of cells are largely determined by 
      their deformability and contractility. The ability of cancer cells to deform and 
      generate contractile force is critical in multiple steps of metastasis. 
      Identifying soluble cues that regulate cancer cell mechanotypes and understanding 
      the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating these cellular mechanotypes could 
      provide novel therapeutic targets to prevent metastasis. Although a strong 
      correlation between high glucose level and cancer metastasis has been 
      demonstrated, the causality is not elucidated, and the underlying molecular 
      mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, using novel high-throughput 
      mechanotyping assays, we show that human breast cancer cells become less 
      deformable and more contractile with increased extracellular glucose levels (>5 
      mM). These altered cell mechanotypes are due to increased F-actin rearrangement 
      and non-muscle myosin II (NMII) activity. We identify the cAMP-RhoA-ROCK-NMII 
      axis to play a major role in regulating cell mechanotypes at high extracellular 
      glucose levels, whereas calcium and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) are not 
      required. The altered mechanotypes are also associated with increased cell 
      migration and invasion. Our study identifies key components in breast cancer 
      cells that convert high extracellular glucose levels into changes in cellular 
      mechanotype and behaviors relevant in cancer metastasis.
