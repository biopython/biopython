The file cyano.txt contains the gene expression data, after preprocessing and
linear spline fitting, of a time-course cDNA microarray experiment of the
cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 under high light conditions.
This experiment is described in

"DNA Microarray Analysis of Cyanobacterial Gene Expression during Acclimation to
High Light", The Plant Cell, Volume 13, pp. 793-806, April 2001.
The k-means clustering result applied to these data was published in
