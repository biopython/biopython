### Test the function generation code
globalxx
globalxx(sequenceA, sequenceB) -> alignments

alignments is a list of tuples (seqA, seqB, score, begin, end).
seqA and seqB are strings showing the alignment between the
sequences.  score is the score of the alignment.  begin and end
are indexes into seqA and seqB that indicate the where the
alignment occurs.

localcd(sequenceA, sequenceB, match_fn, openA, extendA, openB, extendB) -> alignments

match_fn is a callback function that takes two characters and
returns the score between them.

openA and extendA are the gap penalties for sequenceA, and openB
and extendB for sequeneB.  The penalties should be negative.

alignments is a list of tuples (seqA, seqB, score, begin, end).
seqA and seqB are strings showing the alignment between the
sequences.  score is the score of the alignment.  begin and end
are indexes into seqA and seqB that indicate the where the
alignment occurs.
