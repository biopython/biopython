This file provides documentation for modules in Biopython that have been moved
or deprecated in favor of other modules. This provides some quick and easy
to find documentation about how to update your code to work again.

Bio.SwissProt.SProt
===================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.50, and is likely to be deprecated in a future
release. Most of the functionality in Bio.SwissProt.SProt is available from
Bio.SwissProt. Note that Bio.SeqIO currently still uses Bio.SwissProt.SProt;
this will have to be rectified in a future release.

Bio.Prosite and Bio.Enzyme
==========================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.50, will be deprecated in a subsequent release.
Most of the functionality has moved to Bio.ExPASy.Prosite and
Bio.ExPASy.Enzyme, respectively.

Bio.EZRetrieve, Bio.NetCatch, Bio.File.SGMLHandle, Bio.FilteredReader
=====================================================================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.50, will be deprecated in a subsequent release.

Bio.Graphics.GenomeDiagram and colour/color, centre/center
==========================================================
GenomeDiagram originally used colour and centre (UK spelling of color and
center) for argument names.  As part of its integration into Biopython 1.50,
this will support both colour and color, and both centre and center, to help
people port existing scripts written for the standalone version of
GenomeDiagram.  However, we do intend to deprecate and then eventually
remove support for colour and centre in later releases of Biopython.

Bio.AlignAce and Bio.MEME
=========================
As of Biopython 1.50, these modules are considered to be obsolete with the
introduction of Bio.Motif, and they will be deprecated in a future release.

Numeric support
===============
Following the release of 1.48, Numeric support in Biopython is discontinued.
Please move to NumPy for Biopython 1.49 or later.

Bio.Seq and the data property
=============================
Direct use of the Seq object (and MutableSeq object) .data property is
discouraged.  As of release 1.49, writing to the Seq object's .data property
triggers a warning, and this property is likely to be made read only in the
next release.

Bio.Transcribe and Bio.Translate
================================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.49.
Please use the methods or functions in Bio.Seq instead.

Bio.mathfns, Bio.stringfns and Bio.listfns (and their C code variants)
==========================================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.49.
Bio.mathfns and Bio.stringfns were deprecated in Release 1.50
(the deprecation of Bio.listfns is still pending)

Bio.distance (and Bio.cdistance)
================================
Bio.distance was deprecated in Release 1.49, at which point its C code
implementation Bio.cdistance was removed (this was not intended as a public
API).

Bio.Ndb
=======
Deprecated in Release 1.49, as the website this parsed has been redesigned.

Release 1.49.

==========================
Deprecated in Release 1.48.

Bio.Emboss.Primer
=================

which is now obsolete.

Bio.GenBank
===========
The online functionality (search_for, download_many, and NCBIDictionary) was
declared obsolete in Release 1.48, and deprecated in Release 1.50.

Deprecated in favor of Bio.Entrez in Release 1.48.

Bio.Sequencing
==============
A revised API was added and the old one deprecated in Biopython 1.48:
Bio.Sequencing.Ace.RecordParser --> Bio.Sequencing.Ace.read(handle)
Bio.Sequencing.Ace.Iterator --> Bio.Sequencing.Ace.parse(handle)
Bio.Sequencing.Phd.RecordParser --> Bio.Sequencing.Phd.read(handle)
Bio.Sequencing.Phd.Iterator --> Bio.Sequencing.Phd.parse(handle)


Bio.Blast.NCBIWWW
=================
The HTML BLAST parser was deprecated as of Release 1.48.
The deprecated functions blast and blasturl were removed in Release 1.44.

Bio.Saf
=======
Deprecated as of Release 1.48, as it appears to have no users, and relies
on Martel which doesn't work properly with mxTextTools 3.0.

Bio.NBRF
========
Deprecated as of Release 1.48 in favor of the "pir" format in Bio.SeqIO

Bio.IntelliGenetics
===================
Deprecated as of Release 1.48 in favor of the "ig" format in Bio.SeqIO

Bio.SeqIO submodules PhylipIO, ClustalIO, NexusIO and StockholmIO
=================================================================
You can still use the "phylip", "clustal", "nexus" and "stockholm" formats
in Bio.SeqIO, however these are now supported via Bio.AlignIO, with the
old code deprecated in Releases 1.46 or 1.47, and removed in Release 1.49.

Bio.ECell
=========
Deprecated as of Release 1.47, as it appears to have no users, and the code
does not seem relevant for ECell 3.  Removed in Release 1.49.

Bio.Ais
=======
Deprecated as of Release 1.45, removed in Release 1.49.

Bio.LocusLink
=============

interface. We recommend using LIBSVM:

http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/

Bio.RecordFile
==============
