This file provides documentation for modules in Biopython that have been moved
or deprecated in favor of other modules. This provides some quick and easy
to find documentation about how to update your code to work again.

Python 2.3
==========
No longer supported as of Release 1.51, having triggered a warning with
Release 1.50, with a mention in the release notes for Release 1.49.

Python 2.4
==========
No longer supported as of Release 1.59, having triggered a warning since
Release 1.55, with advance notice in the release notes for Release 1.54.

Obsolete file Bio/HotRand.py was deprecated in Release 1.61, consider using
an alternative RNG, or the Python module "randomdotorg".

Bio.Search
==========
Long obsolete file Bio/Search.py was deprecated in Release 1.61.

Bio.Pathway.Rep.HashSet
=======================
Deprecated in Release 1.59, use Python's built in set module.

Bio.SeqFeature.WithinPosition and OneOfPosition

removed in Release 1.57.

Bio.PropertyManager
===================
Explicitly declared obsolete in Release 1.55, deprecated in Release 1.56, and
removed in Release 1.57.

Bio.InterPro
============
This module was a parser for the EBI InterPro webpages, but no longer worked
with their current website. Deprecated in Release 1.55, and removed in
Release 1.58.

Bio.GenBank.LocationParser
==========================
This module used to be used for parsing GenBank and EMBL feature locations.
It has been replaced with faster code using regular expressions, and is no
longer needed. Declared obsolete in Release 1.55, deprecated in Release 1.56,
and removed in Release 1.59.

Bio.Parsers and Bio.Parsers.spark
=================================
This module was a copy of John Aycock's SPARK parser included with Biopython
solely for use in Bio.GenBank.LocationParser. Declared obsolete in Release
1.55, deprecated in Release 1.56, and removed in Release 1.59.

Bio.Restriction.DNAUtils and check_bases
========================================
This module (originally in C) offered complement and antiparallel functions
(duplicating functionality in Bio.Seq) and a rather odd function called
check_bases (also available as Bio.Restriction.Restriction.check_bases).
Deprecated in Release 1.53, removed in Release 1.57.

Bio.Blast.NCBIStandalone
========================
The three functions for calling the "legacy" NCBI BLAST command line tools
blastall, blastpgp and rpsblast were declared obsolete in Biopython Release
1.53, and deprecated in Release 1.61. Please use the BLAST+ wrappers in
Bio.Blast.Applications instead.

The remainder of this module is a parser for the plain text BLAST output,
which was declared obsolete in Release 1.54. For some time now, both the NCBI
and Biopython have encouraged people to parse the XML output instead.

Bio.Blast.Applications
======================
NCBI "legacy" BLAST tool wrappers FastacmdCommandline, BlastallCommandline,
BlastpgpCommandline and RpsBlastCommandline were declared obsolete in Release
1.53 and deprecated in Release 1.61, having been replaced with wrappers for
the new NCBI BLAST+ tools (e.g.  NcbiblastpCommandline and
NcbipsiblastCommandline).

Bio.Clustalw
============
Declared obsolete in Release 1.52, deprecated in Release 1.55 final, and
removed in Release 1.58. Replaced with Bio.AlignIO for parsing and writing
clustal format alignments (since Release 1.46), and Bio.Align.Applications
for calling the ClustalW command line tool (since Release 1.51). See the
Tutorial for examples.

BioSQL and psycopg
==================
Support for psycopg (version one) in Biopython's BioSQL code was deprecated
in Release 1.51, and removed in Release 1.55. Please use psycopg2 instead.

Bio.Application.generic_run and ApplicationResult
=================================================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.51, deprecated in Release 1.53, and removed in
Release 1.57. Please use the Python subprocess module instead, or as of
Release 1.55 the application wrappers can be used directly to execute the
command.

Bio.Entrez.efetch and rettype="genbank"
=======================================
As of Easter 2009, the NCBI have stopped supporting the unofficial return type
of "genbank" in EFetch.  Instead we should be using "gb" (GenBank) or "gp"
(GenPept).  As of Biopython 1.50, Bio.Entrez.efetch will correct this
automatically, but issues a deprecation warning. The code to check and correct
for "genbank" was removed in Biopython 1.55 final.

Bio.Entrez.query function
=========================
Deprecated in Release 1.47, removed in Release 1.52.

Bio.SwissProt.SProt
===================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.50, deprecated in Release 1.51, and removed in
Release 1.56. Most of the functionality in Bio.SwissProt.SProt is available
from Bio.SwissProt.

Bio.Prosite and Bio.Enzyme
==========================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.50, deprecated in Release 1.53, and removed in
Release 1.57. Most of the functionality has moved to Bio.ExPASy.Prosite and
Bio.ExPASy.Enzyme, respectively.

Bio.EZRetrieve, Bio.NetCatch, Bio.FilteredReader
================================================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.50, deprecated in Release 1.52, and removed in
Release 1.56.

Release 1.52, and removed in Release 1.56. Bio.File.SGMLStripper was deprecated
in Release 1.57, removed in Release 1.61. Bio.File.StringHandle was deprecated
in Release 1.59, removed in Release 1.61.

Bio.Graphics.GenomeDiagram and colour/color, centre/center
==========================================================
GenomeDiagram originally used colour and centre (UK spelling of color and
center) for argument names.  As part of its integration into Biopython 1.50,
this will support both colour and color, and both centre and center, to help
people port existing scripts written for the standalone version of
GenomeDiagram.  However, these were deprecated in Release 1.55 final, and we
intend to eventually remove support for colour and centre in later releases
of Biopython.

Bio.AlignAce and Bio.MEME
=========================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.50, deprecated in Release 1.52, and removed
in Release 1.56. Please use Bio.Motif instead.

Please move to NumPy for Biopython 1.49 or later.

Bio.Seq and the data property
=============================
Direct use of the Seq object (and MutableSeq object) .data property is
deprecated.  As of Release 1.49, writing to the Seq object's .data property
triggered a warning, and this property was made read only in Release 1.53. In
Release 1.55 final, accessing the .data property gives a DeprecationWarning.
The Seq object's .data property was removed in Release 1.61.

Bio.Transcribe and Bio.Translate
================================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.49, deprecated in Release 1.51, and removed
in Release 1.57. Please use the methods or functions in Bio.Seq instead.

==========================================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.49. Bio.mathfns and Bio.stringfns were
deprecated in Release 1.50, Bio.listfns was deprecated in Release 1.53.
The three C implementations were all removed in Release 1.53. Bio.mathfns
and Bio.stringfns were removed in Release 1.55. Bio.listfns was removed in
Release 1.57.

Bio.distance (and Bio.cdistance)
================================
Bio.distance was deprecated in Release 1.49, at which point its C code
implementation Bio.cdistance was removed (this was not intended as a public
API). Removed in Release 1.53.

which is suitable even for very large files.

Bio.Fasta (including Bio.Fasta.FastaAlign)
==========================================
Declared obsolete in Release 1.48, deprecated in Release 1.51, and removed
in Release 1.55 final. Please use the "fasta" support in Bio.SeqIO or

Declared obsolete in Release 1.48, deprecated in Release 1.51, and
removed in Release 1.55 final. Please use Bio.AlignIO or the Alignment
object's format method instead.

obsolete in Biopython 1.52, deprecated in Release 1.55 final, and removed in
release 1.58. please use the wrappers for the "new" EMBOSS PHYLIP tools (e.g.
