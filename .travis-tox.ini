# This is a configuration file for tox, used to test
# Biopython on various versions of Python etc under
# the Travis Continous Integration service which is
# configured in the file .travis.yml
#
# By default tox will look for tox.ini, so this file
# will not conflict with any personal tox setup.
#
# You can explicitly use this tox configuration on your
# own machine (via the -c setting), PROVIDED you have
# all the relevant versions of Python installed. e.g.
# specifying a specific target envronment (via -e):
#
# $ pip install tox
# $ tox -c .travis-tox.ini -e py35-nocov
#
# Or with test coverage:
#
# $ pip install tox coverage
# $ tox -c .travis-tox.ini -e py35-cover
#
# Or to run the pep8/flake8 etc Python coding style checks:
#
# $ pip install tox flake8 pydocstyle restructuredtext_lint
# $ tox -c .travis-tox.ini -e style
#
# See the envlist setting for other valid arguments.
